A SA goon tried to sell a Powerbook on eBay, but is contacted by a scammer instead. He decides to play along with the scammer, and hilarity ensues. 

Much later, the scammer, who now realized he was being scammed himself, proceeded to DDoS Harris’ website, P-p-p-powerbook.com[10], and emailed Harris a W32.Beagle virus[11], a worm that mass-emails itself to people in the affected’s address book. No further updates were made to the site or the discussion thread on Something Awful.

While the PDF can basically be found anywhere, the website itself is disappearing. We managed to [a full backup](http://bibanon.org/archives/p-p-p-powerbook.mortencb.cx/index.html) of the original P-P-Powerbook site, movies, and all of it's updates to the Bibliotheca Anonoma.
