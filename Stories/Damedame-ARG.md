DameDame is a trollsub group whose subs have terrible grammar and jokes directed towards /a/nons. 

The trollsub group has created an alternate reality game (ARG) involving a dystopian future 12 years from now, caused somehow or another by the "cartel" of subgroups (mostly Daiz). Yotsumoe, Maddie, and Sam are here from that future to try to save humanity, while BKITNY, Sam's tulpa, was created afterwards. 

With each new subtitle release, there is usually a locked rar within the video, along with a new puzzle on Yotsumoe's tumblr that provides the password. Each new file within the rar provides a cryptic new clue to some aspect of the DameDame members, the future they come from, or what they're trying to accomplish.

There is also a corpse game going on that will be explained later in the article.

One day, Yotsumoe disappeared, and it seems that the mystery was never solved. It is rumored that the whole thing was just a college psychology experiment. It is also rumored that Yotsumoe was suffering from side-effects from time travel. It's also possible that /a/ had lost the game. Regardless of which one of these stories is true, the ARG has ended. Allegedly Yotsumoe and Maddie are both floating around in hell somewhere. 

There was apparently a small game by Erika, an anti-DameDame! spy, but that was probably a while ago.

There is a timeline here: http://pastebin.com/9a6PuajT

### Background

Damedame! are a subgroup who are currently subbing Log Horizon, as well as Kill la Kill. They are jokesubs (Again, think Duwang), and they contain numerous jokes that either come from /a/, relate to it, have reference to popular board culture/Japanese culture, or resound generally well with most people of /a/'s demographic. The thing that makes Damedame! different from not only other subgroups, but even other jokesub groups, is that there's something much deeper behind all of it, along with a few other discerning features.
 
One such discerning feature is the fact that the subbed anime doesn't release in the mkv format that most shows are released in. For t he first two episodes it was released as an mp4, with the excuse that it was a much superior file format than the mkv, citing many legitimate facts. Daiz had to suck on that for a while, however, that was not nearly the end of it. For episode 3 onwards, along with being released as an mp4 file, the Damedame subs were being released in the revolutionary mp5 format! This is described as a format that transcends all other formats, it's only differences to mp4 being 1) It takes up much less space physically, utilizing the wonderful double compression technique, and 2) It has an effect on the subconscious mind. This is where things go from funny haha, to funny peculiar. Yotsumoe starts talking about things as though he might be from the future, and many scientific things are said.
 
### The ARG

At about week 5, a hidden text, a poem (der elkonig) was found in Maddie's twitter profile picture. This was the spark that ignited the fuse, and what started this wild ride. After that, hidden texts have been appearing all over, along with games, puzzles, ciphers, references, mp3 files, locked rars, and the looming threat of an actual body count. As it stands, the format seems to be Prerelease picture on Maddie's Twitter, 1-2 hours before the episode --> Episode mp5 released with new puzzle/text --> Actual puzzle/New text released by Yotsumoe or Maddie 1-2 hours later --> Event.
 
As the weeks progressed, a plot seemed to unfold. The texts seemed to have common themes, and from it, we've come up with a few ideas on how things are. Maddie, the subgroup leader, is probably the devil. This is obvious pretty much from the getgo with some of the texts we've received as well as the multiple allusions to it. Yotsumoe is probably from the future, he even sends emails from different times. Sam is probably dead in the future. In roughly 12 years, there will be a great death, that Yotsumoe is trying to prevent with Maddie. However, as of the time I'm writing this, there's a more pressing matter.
