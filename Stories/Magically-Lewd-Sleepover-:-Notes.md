  **  Notes: Read these first.**


There’s three things you should know before you start reading,

1). Each of these sections was posted roughly 5-11 minutes from one another on average, this plays heavily into the way the story was read for the anons who witnessed it firsthand. I don't expect you to read it as such, but because you know how it was posted, you can maybe enjoy the impact some of the story’s moments had on thread readers.

2). Comments are enabled (To use them, select text and right click, then hit “Comment”), they’ll show up on the side of this document and won’t interfere with the reading of the story in any way. Because of the way 4chan works, commentary is almost an essential part of the story’s experience. Feel free to note down any humor, laughter, feels, even anecdotes and stories of your own. Anons will read them, the author will read them. Just don't be a dick with the system please like spamming the resolve button. Ill moderate that shit myself don't worry.

3). Each update was punctuated with a Woody image (after a while), many hundreds of different ones were used in the writing of this story. Only the best and most relevant are posted here.




**Archived Threads**


These are the Raw threads, in order, the story was posted on.
For all intents and Purposes, this is like reading the story on HARD MODE
There may be serious typos, mistakes or missing lines. I suggest reading them like this only if you can place this document beside them. If this list is incomplete, the links are also below every chapter, so use the table of contents up above.

Do note: That the commentary is absolutely great, and you'll get to experience the suspense and feelings along with every anon that was watching, in nail-biting agony. Along with me-commentary that isn't up on the doc.
