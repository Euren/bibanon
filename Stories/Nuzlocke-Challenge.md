The **Nuzlocke Challenge** is a challenge on /v/ to play a Pokemon game, where your Pokemon will die when fainted, and the player has to make do with the first Pokemon encountered in an area.

This results in much closer relationships with the user's Pokemon, when every battle is a matter of life and death (rather than just "whiting out").

The original author has made [an impressive webcomic dramatizing his experiences.](http://www.nuzlocke.com)

## Original 4chan Threads

The author posted his webcomics to /v/ for a while, before moving on to his own website.

He then came back in a reunion thread, but I'll have to look for that. Unfortunately, it seems to have been Chanarchive, and thus irrevocably lost.
