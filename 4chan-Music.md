This is what happens when you musically inclined anons come together and try to make or to recreate their favorite songs. They aren't perfect, or even all that good, but that's part of their charm. There have been two similar projects on /a/: /a/ Sings and Orchestr/a/. /v/ creates albums of songs, usually new lyrics to the tune of familiar songs. Other boards such as /mu/ and [s4s] opt to craft tunes of their own.

## /a/ Sings
* [Full chronological list of songs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18vFWtuh7gmwo5IwTg0wRBn1KIsfidsf9eCXGZcymbFU/edit#gid=0)
* [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcBuIbmUXy1gF9seaYxkK116oNApr0VtA) - Some of these songs are blocked on Youtube, the remaining ones should be archived as soon as possible and the remixers of the missing ones should be contacted.

## /v/ Musicals
Larger in scope, and likely better organized than /a/'s music corps. Has released three sets of four albums to date.

## Esfores
[s4s]' very own group, running three years strong. While not as prolific compared to /mu/ or /v/'s sheer numbers, Esfores is praised for their consistently high quality albums containing even more intricate references and memes than /v/'s musicals, if such a thing is possible.
