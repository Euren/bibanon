This is what happens when you musically inclined anons come together and try to make or to recreate their favorite songs. They aren't perfect, or even all that good, but that's part of their charm. There have been two similar projects on /a/: /a/ Sings and Orchestr/a/. /v/ creates albums of songs, usually new lyrics to the tune of familiar songs. Other boards such as /mu/ and [s4s] opt to craft tunes of their own.

## /a/ Sings
* [Full chronological list of songs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18vFWtuh7gmwo5IwTg0wRBn1KIsfidsf9eCXGZcymbFU/edit#gid=0)
* [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcBuIbmUXy1gF9seaYxkK116oNApr0VtA) - Some of these songs are blocked on Youtube, the remaining ones should be archived as soon as possible and the remixers of the missing ones should be contacted.

* [First album, on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq6yF7Kh4DY)
* [Second album, on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynux46-MhSY)

## /v/ Musicals
Larger in scope, and likely better organized than /a/'s music corps. Born out of the complaints and controversies in the video game industry frequently discussed on /v/, the series of musicals lampoons figures and franchises alongside taking jabs at their imageboard's culture. Has released four albums to date.
