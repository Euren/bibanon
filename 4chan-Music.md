This is what happens when you musically inclined anons come together and try to make or to recreate their favorite songs. They aren't perfect, or even all that good, but that's part of their charm. There have been two similar projects on /a/: /a/ Sings and Orchestr/a/. /v/ creates albums of songs, usually new lyrics to the tune of familiar songs.

## /a/ Sings

* [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcBuIbmUXy1gF9seaYxkK116oNApr0VtA) - Some of these songs are blocked on Youtube, the remaining ones should be archived as soon as possible and the remixers of the missing ones should be contacted.

## /v/ Musicals
Larger in scope, and likely better organized than /a/'s music corps. Has released three sets of four albums to date.
