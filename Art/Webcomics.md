Comics, once stuck in the rut of bland newspapers, have reached a renaissance on the internet, where they are free to explore various topics or beat down on social issues online or in the physical world.

## Satire

Hilarious comics that lampoon plot holes in modern fiction.

* [Kate Beaton - Hark, a Vagrant](http://www.harkavagrant.com) - Satire about history or literary works.
* [Brawl in the Family](http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/)
* [Nedroid](http://nedroid.com/) - Mad Animal Antics.

## Parody

* [[Poohdickery]] - If you've ever read the original Winnie the Pooh comic strip by Don Ferguson, you'll start to notice that Pooh and his friends are total dicks. No joke, this was actually printed.
* [[Troll Seuss]]

## Vintage

Webcomics from the 1990s or early 2000s.

* [VGCats](http://www.vgcats.com/) - The quintessential video game webcomic.
