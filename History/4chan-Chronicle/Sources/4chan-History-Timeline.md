The 4chan timeline was originally from Wikichan and [JonnyDigital's](http://bibanon.org/everything-shii-knows/www.jonnydigital.com/4chan-history.html) timelines. With time the timeline would spread across many sites (from Partyvan to LURKMOAR), most of them contributing their own data to the timeline. This is an attempt to unify them all and update it to the current events.

> **Note:** It looks like [the timeline I inadvertently saved to Tanasinn.info](http://tanasinn.info/wiki/Complete_History_of_4chan) in 2012 has become preferred by anons (after JonnyDigital started hotlinking to it), so that one will be more up-to-date.  
> Still, this page's timeline has a lot of unique info, and we will keep [[an archive of that timeline on this page|4chan History Timeline#timeline]] just in case.  

However, this page does have the only up-to-date list of board addition dates:

## Timeline

### Pre-History

* 1995 - A man named Masayuki Shiba creates a home party (Dedicated host website from Internet Service providers that you accessed via phone-line) on provider Nifty-Serve called Ayashii World (Ayashii Warudo - あやしいワールド - Strange World), dedicated to a popular Japanese underground game called Kasumigaseki, a game based on the Tokyo Subway Sarin gas attack. He closes it soon after.

* Aug 21, 1996 - Masayuki Shiba recreates Ayashii World in the form of a BBS, inspired by a previous BBS called Japan Lolita Complex Graphics, run by Pedo Koushaku (Duke Pedo) that did not run on Nifty-Serve’s Posoko-Tsushin service but instead was hosted on the Internet through a variety of free web services. With the intention of sharing CP and discussing technology and warez, Ayashii World was entirely dedicated to Japanese Geek culture. 

* Nov 30, 1996 - The first underground web portal called A Door to an Underground (地下道入口, Chikadou Iriguchi), dedicated exclusively to cracking, hacking and technology, died. Its user flocked to Ayashii World, and the discussion topics shifted from CP to less morally upsetting things. 

* Dec 23, 1996 - Digital Eden, Ayashii World’s anonymous BBS provider closes and Shiba adopts Kenjinkai.

* Dec 26, 1996 - Eventually, the shift in the populace led Shiba to divide Ayashii into two BBS, one called 97 for popular topics and another called 2000, for hacking and technology. 2000 would later become the Gesu (scum) board, where the Japanese Internet would see the birth of its raid culture. Gesus carried on invasions, mass trolling and hacking. 

* March 1997 - Strife between Ayashii and 2000 about BBS host changes would lead the users of 2000 to create the Guess BBS, which signaled the birth of the legendary Japanese cracking/hacking group Guess. There a group of the same name discussed and conducted website hackings and invasions. By this time, many similar anonymous BBSes are formed, collectively called Nanashii Warudo (Nameless World), they develop a culture based on memes. Ayashii World functions as the hubsite of the Nanashii World in a similar way to how 4chan would later function as the hubsite of Anonymous. AW's popularity increases exponentially. 

* March 26, 1997 – Kenjinkai shuts down, some claim Ayashii had something to be with it. Ayashii proceeds to use its own servers. By this point, Ayashii World becomes a household name and many other sites are created under its name.

* Aug 5, 1997 – Mr. Amezou starts [[Amezou BBS]], at the time, a normal anonymous 1995 - A man named Masayuki Shiba creates a home party (Dedicated host website from Internet Service providers that you accessed via phone-line) on provider Nifty-Serve called Ayashii World (Ayashii Warudo - あやしいワールド - Strange World), dedicated to a popular Japanese underground game called Kasumigaseki, a game based on the Tokyo Subway Sarin gas attack.

There a group of the same name discussed and conducted website hackings and invasions. By this time, many similar anonymous BBSes are formed, collectively called Nanashi Warudo (Nameless World), they develop a culture based on memes.

* Aug 5, 1997 – Mr. Amezou starts Amezou BBS, at the time, a normal anonymous BSS.
* BSS.

* Aug 1997 – The first imageboard, Licentious Notice Board, is created by Mr. Fujinami. Its userbase exceeds at image collages and the site becomes a fad on the Japanese Internet. However LNB is short lived and no new imageboards are created due to a split between its userbase.

* Mar 1998 - Ayashii World enters a war with Guess BBS, due to Guess sysop Mr. Alice creating an auto-posting script and using it to spam Ayashii.

* Apr 1998 – Despite Shiba’s attempts at stopping his enraged users, Ayashii Worlders overdo it and dox Guess’s administrator, manipulating a RL picture of him. The threat of lawsuit gets Shiba to shut the site down. 

* Apr 24, 1998 – Shiba recreates Ayashii as Ayashii World Main BBS. The Ayashii World sites would grow exponentially, as the Japanese become more accepting of the Internet, and things become more chaotic.
* Sept 3, 1998 – Shiba abruptly brings Ayashii World to an end, citing in his final posts that the site has grown too hostile to contain. 

* Sept 6, 1998 - The Ayashii World is left core-less and in disarray. They need a replacement. They get their replacement with Amezo, the First Channel, ran by Amezou-shi. It starts off as a small BBS and a bunch of links to alternative BBSes for wayward Ayashii Worlders, but it changes it’s posting system from a pile-up BSS form to floating thread BBS, dependent on bumping and saging. Its popularity increases exponentially and it soon one of the main BBSs.

* Sept 20, 1998 – Shiba announces he will be quitting the Ayashii World for good and leaves, with many sister sites to Ayashii closing their doors soon after.

* Sept 29, 1998 – Shiba founds Magmania, one of the first Japanese personal review sites, a new start from scratch after Ayashii. However Mr. Alice, still angered at being doxed and ridiculed, pressures him declaring an official apology on the BBS and via phone. This would lead to Shiba to quit the Internet for good. Mr. Alice would continue to raid anyone who defending Shiba.

* Dec 7, 1998 – Continued pressure from Alice made Shiba request to all Ayashii Worlders to stop using the Ayashii World suffix. Reluctantly, most Ayashii BBSs complied. Those who didn't would be constantly harassed by spammers and hackers. Alice has never admitting committing any kind of pressure towards Shiba, though the evidence was blatant. Mr. Alice becomes the equivalent of the devil to Ayashii Worlders

* Jan 24, 1998 – The Ayashii World sites are reduced to one: Honten. Honten removes the tag after announcing that Alice had gotten hold of their password and access codes. Soon after that Hoten users created AyashiiWorld#REBIRTH.  REBIRTH endures several DDoSs and raids, but eventually manages to surpass Honten in size, mainly thanks to an ads campaign and the introduction of anime logo, which attracted several Otakus, previously shunned by Shiba and the userbase.

* Apr 14, 1999 – REBIRTH’s admin turns out to be a tyrant, so many Ayashii Worlders flock to AyashiiWorld@familie. Its administrator, Mr. Kuhuza, allegedly a well-spoken female, was deemed “moe” by the userbase.

* Apr 29, 1999 – REBIRTH closes. While it was a very important BBS to the Ayashii World, it came to a miserable end. This would be the last BBS whose influence would have any impact on the culture 2ch and 2chan would come to have. Rifts between Shiba fundamentalists and the other Ayashii Worlders would continue for a while.

* May 30, 1999 - Mr. Hiroyuki (ひろゆき- Hiroyuki Nishimura) creates [[2channel]] (2ちゃんねる – Ni Channeru - The Second Channel). It used code based on the first, with enough servers this time to handle the exponential growth. Due to Hiroyuki's desire to create a more general discussion oriented userbase, 2ch attracts a sizable population of Otakus, and begins to separate from the Nanashii World. Even though Hiroyuki had FOX ★ and an army of janitor, threads were pretty much unmoderated and trolling ran rampant. Due to the differences between userbases, Ayashii Worlders, which remain mainly geeks regard 2channelers with animosity. Meanwhile, on the western hemisphere, Lowtax creates [[Something Awful]].

* Oct 10, 1999 – Amezo BBS shuts down due to vandalism. It being one of the very few floating thread BBS, many users try to keep the system alive by creating other sites, but they eventually flock to 2ch. Later, Hiroyuki admits having raided Amezo persistently. Amezo, angry and jealous at 2ch, allies with Mr. Kazuhiko Nishi, founder of ASCII Corporation against 2ch, creating 1ch.tv. However it was not successful, as posting standards where strict and they would later charge a fee to post. There were also rumours that the Yakuza threatened Amezo RL. There’s a general rift between Ayashii Worlders and 2ch users.

* Oct 2000 – Conflicts between 2ch and the Ayashii World reach their boiling point when both sites plan for mass raid campaigns. It is revealed at an AyashiiWorld@REMIX thread, 2ch Wipe Out (2ch抹殺), that 2ch users used Ayashii World uploaders without permission, stole Ayashii Memes and claimed them as their own and made threads about trolling Ayashii World, including The First Experience of Ayashii World, an untouchable sanctuary amongst Ayashii Worlders. Ayashii Worlders used a Phaser Script based on Perlduke Script in order to bring down 2ch. Hiroyuki, realizing how much he fucked up, appeared that the same thread and apologized. The raids and trolling slowly went down, but the animosity between Ayashii World and 2ch already turned into hate, and it was now taboo to speak about 2ch on Ayashii World sites. Currently, Ayashii Worlders and 2ch don’t hate each other anymore, but some friendly rivalry still exists.

* Oct 16 2000 – Hiroyuki appears at Ayashii World II, panic ensues, and Mr. AGSstar comes to speak to him. Betraying most Ayashii Worlders’ expectations, AGS treats Hiroyuki with respect, disassociated himself from the incident and even told him how to restrict IP addresses, regarded as a coward’s move by most of the userbase, since AGS badmouthed 2ch constantly.

* April/May 2001 - Lowtax creates the ADTRW (Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse) board on Something Awful.

* Aug, 30, 2001 - 2ch is in danger of dying, so a backup forum is created, called Futaba or [[2chan]] (two-leaves). Futaba creates a board called /b/, for random content. The site supports images and develops a unique culture all its own, growing out of the seed culture brought by the 2channelers. 

* 2002 - ADTRW creates Raspberry Heaven, a DC++ file sharing hub dedicated to anime, named after the ending of Azumanga Daioh. Raspberry Heaven is itself a spin-off of SADCHUB (The Something Awful Direct Connect Hub), hub created to separate anime from the rest of SA’s topics. Raspberry Heaven had an IRC, #rapsberryheaven, originally hosted at MircX and later Pyoko IRC. There, a 14 years old moot and several ADTRW members were regulars. Users of Raspberry Heaven would discover Futaba, and for a while interact with the site. Interaction is cut short when a massive Korean raid makes Futaba block all non-Japanese users.

## 2003

* 3 March 2003 - The first English language channel is created: [[world2ch]], made by RIR6, a 16 years old Japanese. At first, it supported text only. Its userbase consists of a mix of Japanese and English users, the only time that this happens for any considerable amount of time. The English speakers there are members of ADTRW, and they are also familiar with Futaba and visit it for its quirks. Later, English users would convince the owner to make an imageboard. He makes two, officially becoming the first western imageboards.

* 2003 – The 2chan appreciation thread is created on ADTWR, becoming the gateway between the eastern Internet culture and western. World2ch is discovered and posted on said thread, gaining a steady influx of English speaking users.

* September 29 - [[moot]] registers 4chan.net, just because it looked like 2chan.net (Futaba Channel) Originally, his only intention was to own an e-mail address @4chan.net, but he quickly gets thinking. 

* September 30: Moot announces 4chan.net in Something Awful's ADTRW forum. Thread is titled "4chan.net - English 2chan.net!"

* October 1 - [[4chan]] is founded by moot, a member of the Something Awful forums, intended to be used as an English version of 2chan, a Japanese imageboard created in 2001 out of an extremely popular Japanese BBS called 2channel. moot creates /b/ (Anime/Random) and makes a topic at Something Awful and world2ch about the website, which is received extremely well. moot also holds a contest to decide what 4chan's logo should be. In three hours of creating the contest, around 50 banners are submitted, after which moot decides to simply make it so that it would cycle through the best banners randomly every time a page was loaded. 

* October 2 - 4chan's hosting company receives an e-mail complaining about "lolikon and guro posted in /b/, to which moot writes back that neither of the two is illegal. Later in the day, moot creates a second board, /h/ (Hentai). The email was sent by Shii/Menchi because the people of world2ch felt 4chan ripped them off and tried to raid the place. After some drama moot ended up befriending them. The rules page describes /b/ as a test board which will later become an anime board. moot describes /b/ in a news post as "a retard bin".

* October 6 - moot creates four new imageboards: /c/ (Anime/Cute), /d/ (Hentai/Alternative), /w/ (Wallpapers/Anime), and /y/ (Yaoi), along with an oekaki BBS board. The /y/ board is unique in that (at the time) it was user-moderated. moot also fixes a retention bug that cause posts to be deleted too quickly and raised the maximum number of log entries for each board from 500 to 5000 (2000 for /b/). 

* October 9 - Two new imageboards are created: /g/ (Guro), to clean the nastiest imagery on /h/, and /s/ (Sexy Beautiful Women), both of which are user-moderated. moot announces that 4chan received over one million hits in the past six days and may be looking for sponsors to help pay the bills. /s/ is managed by Boco_T and PotatoSan. Boco_T also drew two of 4chan's title images: one of Osaka from Azumanga Daioh, and one of Cardcaptor Sakura drawn in the style of Fist of the North Star.

* October 16 - 4chan is announced to 2chan, resulting in a massive amount of Japanese users coming to the site, at least doubling the traffic of all boards and decoupling the traffic of /c/. The onslaught of unexpected traffic causes /b/ to crash for two days. Killing it for the first time.

* October 21 - 4chan.net is moved to United Colo, a collocation and webhosting company, following a discussion on the Something Awful forums.

* October 29 – The site is back online. moot makes various changes to the imageboards, including Japanese character display and adding the day of the week to posts. He also announces that the boards will now use a MySQL database (a modified form of 2chan's futabaSQL called yotsubaSQL) and added a robots.txt file to the site to keep out some auto-downloaders, along with an .htaccess file to prevent hotlinking. /g/ temporarily suffered a problem with tripcodes, and all boards had a problem where users said their posts were not appearing and they were getting a Japanese error message. Both of these were fixed within the day by modifying the anti-spam script and fixing the imageboards' .php files, respectively. 

* November 1 - moot begs for donations in the first of a long history of times, complaining that the site is running extremely slowly and that he would have to block Japanese domains unless something was done, and that the cost of moot's server bill was now $400/month. moot warns that 4chan will die slowly unless enough donations are received. 

* November 2 - moot resets img.4chan.net and deletes all posts, drops all MySQL tables, and reduces the maximum post limit for each board from 3000 to 750. MySQLd and PHP were optimized and moot laments that he cannot implement auto-pruning after ten pages like 2chan. 

* November 8 - Two more imageboards are added: /a/ (Anime) and /l/ (Lolikon), because /c/ was flooded with NSFW images. moot announces the future release of a database of archived 4chan threads that requires a paid subscription, which had been suggested by Spork, a mod, a week before.  By this time /b/ lost the anime/random subtitle and became just the random board.

* November 10 - moot and his friend thatdog begin testing on the beta-archive and set up a new board, /r/ (Trains) to test it with. The same day, thatdog registers 1chan.net and sets up a similar train board on his site. /r/ quickly fills with /b/tards in order to help moot out. 

* November 20 – At some point, hosting switched from Colo to Apex, however Apex tells moot that 4chan has to go. 4chan dies for the second time. Hosting then passes to GoDaddy.

* November 22 - The site returns following two days of downtime after the server is reformatted to RH9, making the site considerably faster. moot deletes /r/ (Trains) and announces that the thread archive will be up shortly. The next day, the RH9 apt-get repository was cleared out, causing GIFs not to be thumbnailed correctly for a few hours. 

* November 28 – moot announces downtime to fix some problems.

* November 29 – Downtime canceled. Staff member DJ Lucid managed to fix every single problem without needing to reformat the servers.

* December 16 - A new board is created, /t/ (Torrents), along with a torrent tracker. moot tightens the rules regarding /h/ and /l/ and cracks down on rule breakers. moot also considers blocking Japanese domains due to the fact that they make up half of 4chan's traffic and post only extremely rarely. 

* December 17 - moot blocks all Japanese domains from accessing the site, significantly reducing 4chan's server bill while maintaining the same level of contribution. Apparently, moot says that in the two weeks before the announcement, Japanese domains had accounted for 650 GB but only made about fifty posts or so. 

* December 20 - 4chan changes its board software from modified GazouBBS (modified 2chan code) to Futallaby, created by 1chan's thatdog. 

* December 29 - Following a massive flood of real-life child pornography, /l/ (Lolikon) is temporarily deleted. moot announces that although he has blocked Japanese domains, his traffic from the rest of the world has now passed the rate from before December 17, meaning that moot's server bill is still $400/month. 

## 2004

* January 8 - /l/ (Lolikon) returns along with a new imageboard, /r/ (Request), which was created after many posts on /t/ were requests instead of links to torrents. Although at the beginning it was  created for torrent requests, it quickly morphed into the /r/ we know and love today. 

* January 25 - Censored Vagina announces that the torrent tracker has been taken down due to it being a major strain on the server, along with the /t/ board. Censored Vagina announces that the torrent tracker will return shortly, albeit it in a considerably smaller form, with a maximum of 40 torrents. 

* February 11 - Something Awful user "nubdestroyer" attempts to get 4chan shut down, this time by e-mailing GoDaddy, the owner of 4chan.net. He succeeds. 4chan moves to 4chan.org where it is today.
 
* February 14 - After GoDaddy suspends the 4chan.net domain three days before without moot realizes, he registers 4chan.org as a temporary domain until everything is sorted out.  Thus, 4chan died for the third time.

* February 19 - /t/ (Torrents) returns, albeit without the tracker, along with a new board, /f/ (Flash). moot adds a new server, cgi.4chan.org, on which /f/ is hosted. 

* February 21 - Two discussion boards are added, hosted on 0ch: /amh/ (Anime-Manga-Hentai) and /bbs/ (4chan Discussion). The next day, Censored Vagina makes a newspost announcing that the cost of running 4chan for the rest of 2004 added up to $2,200 and that the money would be needed in donations. The links on 4chan are reflected to link to 4chan.org instead of 4chan.net so that users will not need to write 4chan.org's IP into their hosts file. 

* March 1 - moot announces that the site will not be able to continue because the March server bill is too large to pay and that more donations will be required to pay it or 4chan will die. He makes one final request for donations and hopes for the best.  According to a news post image about the original /q/, /q/ - Questions was added this day.

* March 8 - After a week-long swarm of donations, moot announces that not only does he have enough money to pay the March bill, but that enough money was donated to keep the site running into 2005. moot thanks all donators and posters and announces that he is currently in "Cancun, Mexico". 

* March 28 - The 4chan.org domain becomes permanent, with 4chan.net now occupied by domain squatters (people who buy domains that will get a lot of traffic, such as porn.com, and put ads on the page). moot tells users to inform all people linking to 4chan about this change so that the domain squatters receive as little traffic as possible and therefore not profit from the incident. He  also deletes /g/ (Guro) around this time, possibly due to issues with PayPal. 

* April 1 - As an April Fools' Day prank, moot posts pictures of a man in a graduation uniform shortly after getting his diploma from Stanford University, and posts another picture of the man on April 4, this time showing him next to a statue in Mexico. moot claimed that the man in the photographs was him, and that his name was Robert Bopkins, and this was believed by most of 4chan for a long while until moot appeared in the flesh at the 2005 Otakon Panel, revealing himself to have a teenage-like un-nerdy appearance, which surprised many /b/tards. 

* April 4 - Spork (4chan mod) creates an official IRC channel for 4chan, hosted on irc.pyoko.org. The channel was later moved, hosted on irc.rizon.net, where it remains today. 

* April 19 - 100K GET on /b/ is reached. Many were creating new topics rapidly in hopes of getting the GET for themselves, but 100K GET turned out to be an unrelated text reply in a thread that attempted to be 100K GET. The reply was completely unrelated to the thread that it was in, only saying "lol internet" with no image. To this day, it is considered to be the most win that a GET has ever been. 

* April 30 - moot announces that the text boards are back up, running on board software created by Shii (4chan mod and friend of moot from SA). Two of these text boards were added that day as well: /dis/ (Discussion) and /sug/ (Suggestion) (now both deleted). 

* June 15 - TheRowan, owner of HentaiKey and host of 5chan, disappointed that his site was getting no traffic, attempts to get 4chan shut down. This time by e-mailing PayPal who controlled 4chan's donations at the time. He succeeds and cuts moot of all the donation money he had.

* June 20 - A day that will live forever in short-term memory. 4chan dies for the fourth and longest time, for nearly six weeks. Moot, completely cut from donation money, can’t afford to pay the +500$ dollars bill, so he shuts down the site. He blames it on lack of contribution and donations, asshole posters, and GNAA flooding, among other things, as the reasons for 4chan's death. Many 4channers flocked to the handful alternative chans that were funded, such as iichan and 5chan.

* July 7 – iichan, idlechan, is founded. One of the first 4chan sister sites of the many to come, founded by Thock. Founded in the interbellum between 4chan’s fourth death and the revival.
* August 6 – Due to disagreements with the host, Zadabab shuts 5chan down.

* August 7 - 4chan returns in its fifth incarnation following six weeks of downtime after gathering up enough money and support. Many new moderators and administrators are added as well, post by staff member are made under the name of “The Team”

* August 15 - 4chan changes its board software to a "super-hacked" version of Futallaby coded mostly by W.T. Snacks. It contains many new features such as replying with an image, hiding posts, the Name and E-mail fields, displaying image names and sizes, and linking to other posts by adding a >> next to the post number. Tripcodes were also added to /f/. 

 August 16 - Saved thread reveals that the following boards existed already: "/m/", "/n/" (Trains), and "/cm/" (Cute Male) /cm/ was created to keep male content out of /c/. The discussion boards "/anime"/, "/ascii/" and "/game/" already existed. /r/ was named "/r/ - Request". Top of page boards list: a/b/c/d/f/g/h/l/m/n/p/r/s/t/u/w cm/y anime/ascii/dis/game/sug.

* September 8 - Three new boards are added: /k/ (Weapons), /o/ (Auto), and /sm/ (Shota/Male). Jibaku (4chan mod) announces that /b/ is severely lacking in quality and asks users to contribute better. 

* September 17 – 5chan comes back from the dead.

* October 1 – 4chan turns one year old.

* October 9 - Four boards are added: /ib/ (Oekaki Random), /ip/ (Oekaki Pro), /v/ (Video Games), and /tech/ (Technology, discussion board); one board, /n/ (Trains) is deleted. Around this time, /z/ (ZOMG NONE!!1), a user-moderated board which utilizes the “Idiot King” model from SA’s FYAD, where the userbase has to vote for its mods, is created. With flashing backgrounds, annoying embedded music, and legendary posts. Their first moderator was Soviet Russia !lM51PoudCg).

* October 23 – 5chan closes down permanently due a misunderstanding between TheRowen and Zadabab.

* October 24 – iichan, one of 4chan’s first clone sites (Or rather, sister site, as it did not run on Futallaby but rather Kareha), dies due to lack of founding. Iichan grew big enough to sport its own memes and culture. Months later it’s revived in the form of WAKAchan and adopted by Russians years later in iichan.ru. WAKAchan still exists to this day, and operate sin a manner that there’s no central hosting but rather various persons hosting different parts of the site.

* October 30 - 4chan hosts a panel at the AnimeUSA 2004 Con in Vienna, Virginia. The same day, 4chan experiences DNS problems, and asks that people edit their host files once again. 

* October 31 - /l/ (Lolikon) and /ss/ (Shotakon) are deleted due to threats of legal action. On November 5, moot registers not4chan.org and moves /l/ and /ss/ there instead. On November 15, /g/ (Guro) is deleted as well due to threats from YowCow to seize 4chan's donations account due to guro being against YowCow's ToS. 

* November 1 - squeeks registers 4-ch.net, a site not related to 4chan's text boards. moot complains that squeeks is stealing his thunder. The site is based on 2channel rather than Futaba, and consists of text boards rather than imageboards, and is run on a heavily modified version of Kareha coded by !WAHa.06x36. Man of Wax (4chan mod) begs for donations and advertising on the front page of 4chan. /z/ was deleted shortly after this time. 

* December 24 – moot adds the world4ch BBS, named in honour to the by then defunct world2ch, modeled after 2ch and based on Shii’s board code.

## 2005

* January 6 – Cracky-chan saga - The first picture of a strangely artistic teenager appears on /b/. Anonymous becomes infatuated with the girl and scours the Internet for her pictures. A tripfag under the name of cracky-chan!N1toQkxgzc starts posting.

* January 13 - 4chan's IRC channel moves from irc.pyoko.org to irc.rizon.net. This is announced on the front page, along with one of the first lines ever spoken in 4chan's Rizon channel: <moot> i wish to be the little girl. 

* January 19 - Four new boards are added: /e/ (Ecchi), /3/ (3DCG, stands for 3-D Computer Graphics), /g/ (Technology), and /n/ (Nature & Wildlife). /g/ and /n/ are worksafe. 

* January 27 - Three more boards are added: /ic/ (Artwork/Critique), /p/ (Photography), and /x/ (General Photo). Although there was already a /p/ board for photography before, it is the replacement, with new features (such as EXIF data), /x/ takes a general photography board, where all photography goes, and /p/ becomes specifically about pictures taken by users or artists.

* February 3 - moot and shut register ikuzo.org, a side project they had formulated during 4chan's downtime in summer 2004. The site was basically meant to be a weeaboo site with news and reviews of things like anime, hentai, and general Japanese imports. However, the project is quickly abandoned and the site now redirects to img.4chan.org. 

* February 5 – The Cracky-chan obsession becomes so big W. T. Snacks wordfiltered her name with similarly sounding names (Creaky-chan, fappy-chan, etc). Many stalkers created fansites.

* February 13 - 700K GET is fixed by the mods, with the word "ZERO HOUR" written in extremely large letters and the post count reset to 1, and the message, "ONLY 699999 TO GO GUYS!!". However, the post count is restored within the day. 

* February 26 - Following a IRC townhall, moot creates three more boards: /gif/ (Animated GIF), /hr/ (High Resolution), /wg/ (Wallpapers/General), and removes /x/.

* March 29 – A Livejournal from Cracky, freakygirl, is found. The owner of a Cracky-chan website, Creacky-chan.com claims it’s fake, though it may have been a move to protect her identity. Another Livejournal, kittykat soon gets found, whether fake or real.

* March 31 - moot purchases a new server (tmp.4chan.org, backup of orz.4chan.org) and announces that it will be up in April. He also announces that 4chan will have a panel at Otakon 2005 and announces that he would soon recruit a new administrator following DJ Lucid's (4chan admin) departure. 

* April 1 – Aprils Fur’s Day - For April Fools' Day, moot makes a front-page newspost containing a picture of Robert Bopkins (thought to be moot at the time) in graduation gear shortly after graduating from Stanford University, along with the message "GREETINGS FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL!". moot also creates a new board, /fur/ (Furry), despite his promise never to do so. Although many think it the board is simply an April Fools' Day joke, the board remained the next day, and the board was started to be taken seriously. However, on the morning of April 3rd, everyone who had posted in /fur/ was banned for three months (including /b/tards who posted on /fur/ to denounce furries), following which 4chan was almost rid of furfags. This event has remained embedded in the mind of every furry in hopes of moot ever making a new, permanent version of /fur/.

* April 3 – Shii cracks Cracky-chan’s tripcode. Since the password was “sweet”, the theory of a fake tripfag gains solidity.

* April 6 – Another of Cracky-chan’s Livejournal get known under the name of “scarecrownmaiden”. It contained many more artsy pictures, even nudes. The journal gets deleted quickly by the owner.

* April 7 - 1M GET is reached on /b/. It was considered an "alright" GET, neither fail nor win. 1M GET was posted by a namefag under the handle Senator Rodden Clitoris, who posted picture of Sae Sawanoguchi from Magic Users Club having an orgasm, with the Female Orgasm copypasta, which was deleted within a few seconds. The mods instead chose another thread with a picture of a budgie in a jar and changed its posted number to 1000000 and stickied it, fooling many into believing that it was the true 1M GET. 

* June 6 – Cracky-chan pics become a bannable offense, according to W. T. Snacks, per alleged request of Cracky-chan herself.

* July - /b/ Warchief Rend Niggerhand opens Crackypedia, a place with all storts of stalkerish information about Cracky

* July 1 - Many of 4chan's boards were closed unexpectedly and announcement was supposedly made by "moot's secretary", later known to be staff member Majnem was posted on the front page, announcing that moot had abandoned 4chan and that 4chan would cease operations in a few days due to lack of funding. The next day, moot made a newspost announcing that that this had all happened behind his back, and that the post was neither true nor official. 

* July 29 - /b/ reaches 2M GET, a picture of someone holding up a notepad with "2000000 GET?" written on it, and the text "HAY GUYS! 2MIL GET! -Delcious Ironing" [sic]. This was (badly) photoshopped with a smiling ugly man and the text, "HAY GUYEZ WOULD YOU BE UP FOR SOME ADULT FUN AT MY COUNTRY CLUB SOMETIME -Delcious ron", which spawned a whole series of other shopped GETs. 

* August 12 – Saturgay, /b/ gets spammed with images of Seizure 5, Hard Gay and Sageman

* August 13 - Shortly after celebrating one year of uptime, 4chan starts its panel at Otakon 2005, the first time ever that /b/tards actually met the real moot, after which moot revealed that "Robert Bopkins" was not only not him, but that Bopkins' name was actually Eric J. Ross and that moot picked the photos at random. Everyone has a really good time and moot hangs out with the other /b/tards who flip out over the fact that they are experiencing mootfaggotry IRL. 

* August 28 - Donate or Die 2005 - moot announces that he requires $20,000 in donations to purchase three new servers (bin.4chan.org, nov.4chan.org, and a second img.4chan.org). Frenzy started, with camwhores showing their tits and vagoo if users donated to 4chan. Within a week, $14,000 was raised, which was actually enough to purchase the three servers, although they fell short of their goal. Later, on September 15th, moot announces that donations will cease September 30th, and even then can only be delivered by snail mail. 

* October 1 - 4chan turns two years old. Dan makes a commemorative picture.

* October 16 - 3M GET on /b/, with a picture of Waha and Pedobear and how they would be seen in America. The post linked to itself, prefixed by ">>3000000" and "TIME PARADOX/what a lame GET/Surely you jest!". It was, unfortunately, a tripfag get, posted by 4chan mod Pixel Hotness !Ol2RiO/0Ro. The GET was considered "meh" for being a modGET. 

* October 25 - moot announces that "things are looking up" and announces that many new features will be added to 4chan, including the DevBlog. He also begs for people to advertise because he needs money to construct additional pylons. 

* October 30 - moot and Snacks have a long fight over IRC as moot takes the site down for a few hours to fix some problems. moot rages against Snacks for being a lazy coder and threatens to take away his server access, and generally being very arrogant towards Snacks. They both go to sleep, and continue in the afternoon the next day for about three hours, until moot tells Snacks that he will remove his server access (along with his moderator powers), which he does shortly afterwards, making him unable to moderate or code. Snacks then "leaves" 4chan for good. 

* November 2 - moot challenges Xenon, a popular flash artist camwhore whose artwork is often spammed on /f/, to a camwhore battle, which moot loses. moot then tells Xenon that since he beat him, Xenon received temporary admin status and moot declared November 2 to be "the Day of Xenon". Xenon used his new privileges to change /b/'s CSS layout, resulting in /b/'s background becoming pink and the Powerpuff Girls theme song being embedded into every page. /b/'s title was also changed to "All Hail Xenon". 

* November 3 - moot, liking the idea of fucking around with /b/'s layout, changes /b/'s background to a seizure-inducing GIF flashing yellow and white, with the techno-country song "Cotton-Eye Joe" by Rednex embedded into the pages. /b/'s title was then changed to "ON A STEEL HORSE I RIDE", and a sticky was created in which the new layout could be discussed. 

* November 4 - Shortly after midnight, /b/'s layout was changed again to a pink McDonald's-themed background, with "moving JavaScript Golden Arches" as Lurkmore put it, along with a 1980s McDonald's jingle added as background music. This hack lasted for three days and was hated by almost everybody. During this time, Xenon released the chatlogs from moot and Snacks' fight, causing massive outrage on /b/. 
* December 19 - moot posts a thread in /v/ asking for applications to be a janitor (person who can delete posts but not ban), which was up to that point unheard of. News of this spread to /b/, and many applications were received, and the janitors were implemented within the month.

## 2006

* January 30 - moot implements forced anonymous on /b/, with users unable to post with a name, tripcode, or subject, remaining until March 26, 2007, which, by then, it had definitely worn out its welcome. 

* February 6 - orz.4chan.org and cgi.4chan.org crash and are not fixed until three days later. During this time, the secret board, /5/, hosted on the orz server, was deleted. 

* February 12 – Cracky-chan discovers her cult and decides it’s enough. She makes a public statement on 420chan telling everyone to stop. Later, Kirtaner closes the board.

* February 17 - The three new servers purchased during the Donate or Die 2005 campaign are successfully brought online. Each served as a backup for three of 4chan's content servers, with nov.4chan.org backing up cgi, bin.4chan.org backing up zip, and tmp.4chan.org backing up orz (img was already backed up by dat.4chan.org). In addition, the new servers took care of all post submissions, speeding up the boards significantly. 

* February 18 - The day after the new servers are installed, 5M GET is achieved, during which the posting rate increased twenty fold. The servers were put to the test, with jumbo.4chan.org maxing out its line at 99.31 Mbit/s (~12.41 megabytes per second). The 5M GET was a picture of cat taken at an angle that made the cat look large, with the text "Needs more towercat". Users were divided between whether it was win or fail, although moot himself called it "more garbage" in the DevBlog. 

* March 23 - 6M GET was achieved on /b/, with a picture of Senator Bill Frist holding up a card and the text "In after 6M GET". It was mostly considered a winGET due to the potential for epic shoops. 
* April 1 - /b/'s CSS is fucked with yet again, with the page layout being changed to tanasinn.org's layout, with a looping voice saying "Don't think. Feel and you'll be Tanasinn." Letters were randomly changed to the three-dot triangle symbol. 

* April 4 – moot makes a joke – BAD END. moot was eaten by a shark. ~fin ~

* April 6 - Three new trial boards are added: /co/ (Comics & Cartoons), /po/ (Papercraft & Origami), and /sp/ (Sports). Two days later, five more boards are added: /cgl/ (Cosplay & EGL), /ck/ (Food & Cooking), /mu/ (Music), /n/ (News) (Changing /n/ - Animals & Nature to /an/), and /tv/ (Television). 

* April 10 – When a user shows his ban reason as being DSFARGEG, he is banned and his thread stickied. Later seven threads are stickied, are stickied along with another DSFARGEG post, which consisted on a puppet from a Japanese show riding a motorcycle. 

* April 11 – /b/tards start to spam /b/ with the same puppet. Every post gets stickied and banned. This concluded with entire pages consisting only of stickied bans. DSFARGEG would be banned on sight from them on.

* April 14 - moot announces that the three servers purchased during Donate or Die 2005 have been collocated and are up and running and also announces that he will rarely use the front page for small updates from now on, instead choosing to announce them on the DevBlog and blotter. moot also announces that 4chan will have a panel at which he will appear at AnimeCentral 2006, which took place on May 4. The next day, moot removes most of the wordfilters on /b/ and implements new ones. 

* April – Many of the original wordfilters are removed and new ones are implemented.

* April 20 - 7M GET is reached, but due to the high strain on the server, the file was deleted, and the post had no text. However, mods retrieved the MD5 data from the picture from their database and found that it was the popular image macro of Chopper Dave from Sealab 2021 shouting "UH OHHHHHHH". In the same day, /b/ discovers that 13-year-old Mitchell Henderson kills himself over an iPod, after which /b/ raids his memorial MySpace and the "an hero" meme is born after a classmate of his posted a poem she written on his memorial account in which she constantly referred to him as "an hero". 

* May 11 - Eight threads are stickied, all consisting of modified versions of a picture from some Japanese show with a puppet riding on a motorcycle and the text "DSFARGEG". All posts were followed by (USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST) and DSFARGEG almost always resulted in a ban or a sticky. 

* May 18 - /b/ reaches 8M GET, one of the first GETs to be auto-stickied. It was considered a WinGET, due to the fact that it was a picture of George Zimmer and the text "HI, I'M GEORGE ZIMMER, FOUNDER AND CEO OF MEN'S WAREHOUSE. THIS IS 8000000 GET. I GUARANTEE IT". 

* June 15 - Comedian Tom Green starts his own late-night call-in talk show hosted from his own living room, hosted every night at 11 PM EST. Over the next three months, /b/ trolls his show, with around 10% of all calls on the show being prank calls from 4chan. /b/ also focused on a section of his show, "Girl Talk", which featured five stereotypical "dumb chicks" giving advice on relationships. The trolling of Girl Talk was so intense that it was canceled on August 19th because of it, combined with bad response from viewers. It would eventually become a tradition to raid Tom Green whenever he went.

* June 17 - A group of anons crapflood the Zelda Guide Forums for fun, after which a member threatens to "hack" 4chan. This prompts their leader, known as "Captain Cornflake" (the name of his raid account on Zelda Guide Forums, he was anonymous on /b/) to post this information to /b/. Many Anonymous joined the raid following this post and crapflooded the forums nearly into oblivion during the night while the moderating team was asleep. As the moderators were surveying the carnage the next morning, one mod actually pleaded for /b/ to stop and said he would give them their own board to spam, which just increased the raid. The forums now require manual admin verification, which keeps out many legit users, resulting in an anon victory. 

* June 19 - Yet another epic raid occurs, with /b/ destroying naruto-kun.com after a user there posted about their dislike of 4chan. Following a major porn flood after which the site admin threatened to sic the FCC on 4chan, one anon discovered a source code document hidden on the site containing the site's SQL database password (which Anon posted on /b/) as well as loads of unchecked MySQL injection vulnerabilities. Anonymous also discovered that the fucking dumbass's FTP had the same password as his MySQL database, following which tons of anons logged in to the FTP account and deleted everything, destroying the entire site, including premium accounts and the database, and bringing the site down for two days. 

* July 4 - The first of many in a series of /b/ CSS hacks in July as the background was turned red and the text yellow. July 10th saw the theme song from "Bill Nye the Science Guy" embedded into the background (no layout changes however), while July 15th harbored a sticky in which "Also Sprach Zarathustra" by composer Richard Strauss (2001: A Space Odyssey theme song) was embedded. Toward the end of July, ten threads were stickied, taking up the entire first page of /b/, and the theme song from Inspector Gadget was embedded into /b/. 

* July 6 – Crackypedia closes per (alleged again) Cracky-chan’s request. The owner posts a macro with the date of closure, viewcount (17464) and the message "Hope you enjoyed it folks, I told you it wouldn't last forever."

* July 7 - 10M GET is reached, considered the most failed GET of all time, simply a picture of Hazuki from the anime Tsukuyomi -Moon Phase- on a merry-go-round, with the text "hazukiget". Ironically, it was much later revealed to be a modGET, but with no trickery involved; Shii (4chan admin; coder of discussion boards) got the GET out of pure luck, proving that all modGETs, staged or not, will always be fail. 

* July 8 - 4chan returns after nearly a day of downtime. There has not been any honest answer in regards to the cause, some claim it was due to 4chan's bandwidth provider, Cogent, and the image flood to reach the 10000000 GET; to reports of the FBI seizing the hardware in search of CP.

* July 12 – The great Habbo raid of July 2006 - 4chan (along with Encyclopedia Dramatica, YTMND, GNAA, Bantown, and myg0t) storm Habbo Hotel. A virtual online role playing game where, among other things, people pay real-life money for online money. Thousands of "nigras" (black characters with afros wearing business suits, the official raid costume) filled nearly every room on the site, especially the Pool Deck, during which the pool was blocked for hours because the pool had AIDS. The sheer number of Anonymous was so great that the Habbo mods could not ban the nigras faster than the accounts were being created, resulting in the mods having no choice but to reset their server, after which the raid continued for a few more hours on Habbo servers in other countries, particularly the German Habbo Hotel (where the nigras would form in swastika patterns). The Habbo raid is often considered /b/'s best and spawned the "Nigra" meme and the "Pool's closed" meme. The word "AIDS" was later wordfiltered on Habbo as a result of the raid. 

* July 16 - Moderators make a sticky of a girl known as Ban-Chan, knowing full well that it is CP. Later that day, in a hypocritical statement, moderators inform 4chan that there will be less tolerance for posting illegal things.

* July 20 - moot announces that they will have a panel at Otakon 2006 from August 4-6 in Baltimore, Maryland, with enough seating capacity to allow 680 people compared to the 230 from Otakon 2005. 

* July 22 - /v/ reaches 1M GET, considered to be one of the greatest non-/b/ gets of all time. The GET was a picture of PONG, the first-ever video game, thus a very fitting get for /v/. A small group of users believe that the GET was staged, citing an overload of Final Fantasy VII pics as the reason.

* August 4 - Otakon 2006 starts and so does 4chan's panel. Many important 4channers are there, including moot, shut, Shii, and the apparent return of W.T. Snacks. An epic sermon was delivered by "Reverend" Lemmy Caution to spread the gospel of Raptor Jesus, and moot even created a new board, /con/ (Conventions), for people at the con to use, which was deleted a few hours after the con ended. 

* August 12 - The 4chan :codes: (words put between colons that are turned into smilies, like how posting :happy: would display a happy emoticon, for example) are released to the site. They are soon spammed all over the place, and threads are pruned extremely quickly. Images and .gifs of "eng101", "w00t", "SAGE" (the classic blue Sega image edited to spell sage), "owned", "iceburn", the classic flashing "5", the green 4chan "cone", "sweatdrop", and "Hard Gay" were posted in large amount, often causing threads to be derailed in seconds.

* August 16 – The Tom Green raids - Tom Green, an Canadian host in an Internet call in show, Tom Green’s House Tonight, gets massively prank called by /b/tards, who made him hold a paper with the work b written on, wear a wig, suffered an hour long of DESU spam and meme spouting such as “Do a barrel roll”. All these calls ended up clogging the lines and keeping actual fans from calling in. Green gets pissed enough that he announces on live TV: “thanks to you assholes this will no longer be a call in show”. The next show in line was GirlTalk, which also got raided by /b/. This raid is possible because neither shows screened their calls.

* August 22 - A group of Anonymous go on a midnight raiding spree, eventually attracting tons (~100) of Anonymous to their posse in raid threads. They charged, destroying Proana.us (a pro-anorexia community), deleting all accounts on the site. After this (by now around 1:00 AM of August 23), they attempted to raid the myg0t forum, but the raid failed due to myg0t's massive size. Instead, they raided teenbabynet.org (not only furries, but teenage furries with diaper fetishes), locking the forum and rendering it totally unviewable by 10:00 AM. At around this time, they turned their attention to WikiFur, leaving it in complete disarray. With mods extremely worried, moot does something drastic around noon of August 23... 

* August 23 – The /b/-day - moot (in a somewhat justifiable fit of anger) posts a sticky announcing that anyone who posts illegal content will get you permabanned and possibly arrested, and that even people who REPLY to illegal threads will receive a two-week global ban, with the definition of "illegal threads" referring to CP, jailbait, personal info, and raids (some of /b/'s most cherished traditions). This led to a massive outcry due to the fact that this policy was technically introducing rules to /b/, whose main goal was to be a rule-free board. CP/Jailbait is posted in defiance, mass "WTF IS THIS SHIT" spamming and Hitler references. There was a sudden universal reset. /b/ had no posts, and the sticky was gone. It was soon replaced with a new sticky restating the policy in a softer manner, only to be re-stickied and a new thread with the original text with added information stickied, which was then de-stickied and re-stickied over and over by moot and other mods that disagreed with him. This along spamming from angry /b/tards, caused img.4chan.org to crash, leaving 14 boards, including /b/, /an/, /b/, /c/, /cm/, /g/, /k/, /m/, /o/, /p/, /r/, /s/, /t/, /v/, and /w/ inaccessible. A civil war broke out, with many /b/tards permanently leaving 4chan and taking up new homes at 7chan, AnonIB, IIChan, 2ch.ru, and 420chan. moot got rid of the policy very shortly afterwards due to the enormous backlash. However, img.4chan.org didn't return until August 25, two days later.  Eventually, it would be considered that the events of the /b/-day where a failure, because a week later /b/ was doing the same routine as if it never happened. On the rest of the Internet, however, this resulted in a massive increase of alternative image boards, like WTFux, 7chan, 2ch.ru and others where many banned users took an exodus to. This marked the rise of the /i/nsurgence, given that 7chan and AnonIB housed an /i/ board, long forbidden by moot, for the first time the /b/tard would orchestrate raids on an organized fashion.

* August 25 - /b/ is restored with img.4chan.org, inciting floods by opponents of the mod's new policies. Later this day www.anonib.com/invasions/ is flooded (presumably) by 4channers with desu and images of Suiseiseki, leading to the board crashing and all of the content being deleted. Debates and flamewars sparked across /b/ between both opposing sides. In addition, /b/ in general had been divided into two factions of /b/tards with the original /b/ claiming the majority. Many /b/tards trolled both sides and managed to spark a few debates over which board was better. One side saying the other had gotten boring while the other side claiming the others weren't real /b/tards. Eventually the threads burned themselves out and the people went to bed.

* August 26 - Despite all the internet drama; 4chan /b/ is online and back to running as normal. Floods by those angry with the more vigilant enforcement of long-standing rules against illegal content have mostly subsided. The only remaining conflicts have led to meme wars and a competitive "Who's better than who?" flood war. However, the rage slowly calmed and the major populace of both 7chan and 4chan grew tired of it. What was left were threads developed with the hopes of cultivating peace, harmony, and friendship, but ultimately things ended in bitter separation.

* September 4 - World-famous Australian "croc hunter" Steve Irwin is killed by a stingray barb to the heart while filming a documentary. /b/ is immediately flooded with this information and one of the first threads to announce it was stickied for a week, becoming the most replied-to thread in /b/ history with slightly over 5,200 replies (later beaten by the "#fortune" sticky on April 27, 2007). Many Rule 34s and general parodies are posted in /b/ during that time. 

* September 11 – Habbo, Revisited - In response to Steve Irwin's death, the fifth anniversary of 9/11, and hatred for Habbo Hotel, /b/, led by AFRODUCK, starts another massive raid on Habbo, with around 5,000 Anonymous partaking in the raid (~600 nigras on the Pool Deck alone). They blocked every single room, announcing that not only did the pool have AIDS, but also had stingrays as well. The raid continued for entire days until September 14.

* October (May have happened as early as January) – After a new wave of janitors is recruited, moot adds /j/, the secret staff board, back then known as /j/ - Janitor (Nowadays named Janitor & Moderator Discussion). The first thread is moot ordering all janitors to report there, failure to comply after a week resulting in loss of privileges/ban. 

* October 1 - /b/ celebrates its third anniversary, and places blue-and-pink striped party hats on the top of each thread. /b/tards made pictures interacting with the hats, causing many threads that are epic win (a good chunk of epic thread screencaps are from this day). Dan makes a second commemoration.

* October 20 - Jake Brahm turns himself in to authorities following a now-infamous copypasta that he had written, reposting it around 40 times within the previous 30 days, in which he warned of simultaneous terrorist attacks against seven football stadiums across the United States on October 22nd. Two days before this, on October 18, the Department of Homeland Security was notified about the copypasta and attempted to track down and arrest the creator of it; when the Wauwatosa, Wisconsin police department (Brahm's town of residence) received a tip on October 20, he turned himself in and faces up to 20 years imprisonment, thus making him the only person to have been party v& for his actions as of 2007. The phrase "DON'T MESS WITH FOOTBALL", uttered by FBI agent Les Wiser during a news report on Brahm's arrest, has since become a meme. 

* October 30 – Habbo, Revisited 2 or the Habbo fail raid – Somewhere around 100 nigras gather around Habbo Hotel, but are banned quickly.

* November 7 - After moot doesn't pay the bills, the site goes down for two days, during which a page was put up explaining that the servers were gone because moot didn't pay and that the problem would be fixed within "24-48 hours" (crossed out with "FIFTY-BILLION YEARS" written next to it). Many /b/tards, looking for a temporary *chan to go to until 4chan returns, cause a major spike in traffic for other *chans as /b/tards go there temporarily. 7chan and 12chan were destroyed by the flood of traffic and suffered severe downtime. 

* November 21 - /b/space day – A /b/tard loads a keyloggers on a public PC and gives /b/ over 40000 MySpace accounts and passwords. Of course, they proceed to have a field day over it.

* November 30 - moot announces that more banner ads from AdBrite will be added to 4chan in December due to the fact that donations are no longer possible. As a result of the extra money, 4chan becomes faster after moot uses the money for extra bandwidth capacity. 

* December 8 - Only 19 days after /b/'s 16 millionth post, /b/ reached the 17 million mark late December 8th. This marks the shortest time it has ever taken to get another 1 million posts in all of /b/ and 4chan's history. Of course, in the following years, getting 1 million posts in a day would become something trivial.
* December 20 - Hal Turner, a white supremacist talk show host from New Jersey, plans his final radio show due to lack of funding, in which he takes calls for three hours straight. However, a combined surprise raid from 4chan, 7chan, YTMND, Something Awful, and Bantown destroyed Hal's show, with 150 prank calls being made in three hours, with almost none of his real listeners being able to call in due to clogged lines. Hal then posts the phone numbers of the callers on his website (some of which were minors), sparking a huge outrage among /b/. Bantown then uncovered his personal information, including his real phone number, after which ~160 calls were made to his house. Hal gave in and removed the phone numbers from his site, but as we all know, Anonymous does not forgive. 

* December 24 - Taking /b/ by surprise on the eve of Christmas, Anonymous posts a story no truer than that of the wildest fantasies of /b/tards and surprisingly, admits it's wrong. What's even more amazing is that Anonymous sympathizes with Anonymous. This day is the birth and story of /b/man: A Christmas in the life of Anonymous.

* December 25 - Hal Turner spends Christmas with his family over at his father's house; news of this spread, and Bantown quickly found his father's number, leading to a massive amount of calls and Hal supposedly being kicked out of the house. After this, Hal claimed that the FBI was investigating 4chan (an Anonymous later called in to Hal's show claiming that he had contacted the FBI and that they had said that no such investigation was taking place) and redirected his website to the FBI page. 

* December 31 - A happy ending for 2006 after Hal Turner surrenders to 4chan after much raiding and lulz, and announces that he is almost off of the internet completely. He announces, "I am not certain where to go from here. My entire existence - short of my physical presence on this planet - has been utterly wrecked, by people I never met from places I've never been." Anonymous knocks back a cold one and lols heartily. 

## 2007

* January 3 – Hal Turner’s third radio show gets dropped midsession allegedly because a hacker called Slogh held a grudge against him, and launched a botnet to DDOS the site.

* January 5 – Hal Turner redirects his website to the FBI for a while in an effort to deter trolls.

* January 9 - moot posts on the front page, announcing that 4chan would soon have interstitial ads due to dwindling revenue. moot also allows all of the trial boards created on April 6, 2006 to become full boards, except for /sp/ (Sports), which is deleted. 

* January 10 - All text disappears on /b/, with users only being able to talk through pictures or the E-mail field. Needless to say, this was win, and caused /b/ to be fag-free for a few hours. 

* January 22 – Hal Turners has enough and deletes his site.

* January 24 – Ian, owner of 7chan, gets a notice from his host saying that the board /i/ violates the TOS. He deletes it. Meanwhile, Hal Turner gets kicked from his datacenter, and on the way to get a new way crashes his car.

* January 27 – The great chan death of January 2007 - 4chan has a power failure and dies in the usual manner, however, so do all the other mayor imageboards of the Internet. 420chan was kicked out of from hosting, 12 was suspended by the FBI, 2ch.ru died for unknown reasons, and 7chan couldn’t handle the influx of all the users bases put together and crashed. Even wikichan went down, to never return.

* February 1 – Hal surrenders and claims to quit the internet. However that statement got the New York Times and a couple of watchers interested so he had more money for funding-.

* February 3 - 20milGET is achieved, 16 days after 19milGET.

* February 10 – Hal Turner redirects his own site to 420chan.org and claims the “Canadian Communist” Kirtaner hacked him. However a WHOIS search showed the truth.

* February 12 – He gets his page back

* February 15 - Two new boards are added: /tg/ (Traditional Games) and /x/ (Paranormal), the latter being created due to the popularity of 7chan's /x/ board and a rising creepypasta culture on /b/. moot also announces the winners in a contest for new banners. The next day, janitor applications are opened and then closed four days later, with the new janitors being implemented around early March. 

* March 7 – Hal makes another radio show, anonymous raids him again. He dedicated the show about the 21/4 raid.

* March 21 - Anonymous discovers photos of 16-year-old Kelly Isenhower of Georgia sucking off her dog, as well as her phone number and address. Needless to say, Anon went batshit, raiding her DeviantArt and MySpace, calling her parents and telling them about the incident, and even e-mailing the photographs to her school principal, although she was adamant that the photos were shopped (which they obviously weren't). She was suspended from school indefinitely, her dog was taken away, and everyone now hates her, including all her former friends and her parents. Anonymous rejoices. 

* March 26 – The Great re/b/oot - moot announces a re/b/oot and aims to restore /b/ to its former glory. Two stickies are created, one being a letter moot received that inspired him to start the re/b/oot, and another sticky being his formal apology for "letting /b/ turn to shit". /b/'s background changed to a seizure-inducing flashing yellow and white background with the song "Cotton-Eyed Joe" embedded in the background. The Name and Subject fields return to /b/, effectively ending forced anonymous and allowing tripcodes. Many people were banned by moot in both stickies for comments such as "/b/ sucks", and in many other threads as well. Later, a third sticky was made which was a locked thread with only two posts, with the OP announcing that he was "afraid of being banned by the crazy bitch-ass mods" and also said, "You might as well make rules for /b/ now faggots", followed by which the poster was banned. Later in the day, 23M GET was achieved, which was a picture of a Pokemon with text InfernalRape and the past consisted of INFERNALGET. Considering this to be an extreme failGET (as did all of /b/), moot banned the poster, instantly transforming it into a winGET. 

* March 27 – Transmission - The next day, /b/'s title changes to “Transmission” with Trans italicized and the background turned /b/lack, and techno music was played, specifically “You could easily have me” by Motronomy. A sticky was posted containing a picture of Diglet and said, "/b/ is /b/ again". Many users were banned in the thread for suggesting otherwise. 

* March 28 – Revolution - /b/'s title changed to “Revolution” and the background was changed yet again to gray with red tripcodes (allowing users to impersonate moot every easily), techno music was added with the prominent line, "I am the creator". A sticky was posted in which a user was banned for posting DSFARGEG. 

* March 29 – Showdown - The day after that, the title was Showdown and the background was changed to a rapidly flashing rainbow background, as well as the posts. A techno version of the song "Eye of the Tiger” with elements from “Let Your Backbone Slide”, called “Tiger Said Knock You Out” by Neon Kobra, was added as background music. Four stickies were created, each with a GIF of a rainbow-flashing number 5 and the four stickies contained one line each of the song's opening verse (This is a showdown/A throwdown/Hell no, I can't slow down/It's gonna go). 

* March 30 – Intermission - The next day, /b/ returned to normal, with a normal layout and no background music, during which /b/'s title was changed to "Intermission". 

* April 1 - Following two days of normal /b/, techno music was again added as background music, but the CSS remained unchanged, signaling the end of the re/b/oot. 

* April 20 - 4chan administrators are forced to temporarily shut down img.4chan.org after a thread containing four uncensored images of child pornography became stuck on the front page for over an hour (during which nobody could post) and could not be deleted due to MySQL problems. Rather than getting v&, the plug was pulled on img.4chan.org and was restored around 12-15 hours later. During the downtime, since 7chan was down as well, a massive amount of /b/tards flocked to 420chan, thus ruining 420chan's most special day, 4/20. 
* April 21 – Hal Turner fail IRL raid – Hal Turned hyped the shit out of a supposed IRL raid, called two cop units, and ambulance and various friends. Only four channers, two anons and two girls (Or traps?) came in.
* April 27 - "Fortunes" are introduced to /b/, a feature that moot had implemented from the very beginning but had never told anyone about. Basically, if you put your name as "#fortune", you will get a random fortune at the top of your post, chosen at random. moot announced it to the public after another mod told him to reveal it, causing mass spamming of fortunes. A thread in which someone guessed their own fortune was stickied and became the most replied-to thread in /b/ history, beating the Steve Irwin thread in just 19 hours with 5,336 posts. 

* April 28 – Subeta raids - 4chan, 7chan, and especially 420chan combine forces to attack Subeta, a faggot role-playing website similar to Gaia who stole Longcat and turned him into an item for their faggoty site. When the chans complained, Subeta DDoSed 420chan, leaving it in ruins and sticking Kirtaner (420chan's owner) with a $6,000 server bill. The *chans then DDoS Subeta, which they find hard to do due to lack of effort, as well as Subeta's 2000 GB monthly bandwidth and lack of large images. Nevertheless, two major Subeta fansites were shut down permanently and Subeta was down for two days. Keith (Subeta's owner) eventually apologized and removed Longcat from his site after a long and bloody battle, at which many Anonymous rejoiced. On this same day, Encyclopedia Dramatica, one of /b/'s most famous recruiting posts, encountered a severe hard disk failure and does not return until June 8. 

* May - first known instance of a Rickroll in 4chan's /v/. Related to Grand Theft Auto. 

* May 13 - moot changes /b/'s layout so that everything is the same color (excluding checkboxes and fortunes), meaning that users will have to press Ctrl+A (Select All) or disable CSS in order to view text. A sticky is posted in which moot explains that the color change is to keep stupid people out, which moot closed a few hours later at around 1,900 posts. moot also announced that threads would go back to the limit of 250 posts and 100 images instead of 1000 posts and 500 images, so that topics can be pruned easier and that the directory dumper would be harder to abuse. The color change lasted a week (during which posting rates decreased by 10%) after which it was disabled, triggering some anger from some /b/tards who wished that the cancer could have been kept out longer. 

* June 5 - /co/ reaches 1M GET; the thread disappears within five seconds or so, and due to the strain on the server, the file was deleted as soon as it was uploaded. The post also had the text, "reducto get", referring to Reducto from Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, meaning that the picture was most likely one of him. The next day, /b/ reaches 29M GET, which the original poster deletes after three hours after being persuaded to do so in another thread. 

* July 12 – The Great Habbo Raid of July 2007 – Commemorating one year of the most epic raid ever done, /b/ sets out to raid Habbo hotel once again. This time, the mods decide that “If you can’t beat them, join then” via declaring international Afro day. However this resulted in racist implications. There were many complains about the raid, mainly coming from lack of organization, but everyone agrees it was just as funny as the last year. At the same time, Tom Green makes a midnight show, completely drunk, and gets one single prank call from the anons. He spends the rest of the show shouting BARREL ROLL and MUDLIFFS at every caller, ended up closing the show half an hour earlier.

* June 16 - 30M GET is achieved one hour after midnight, when many /b/tards are asleep. It was an extreme failGET, as was 10M GET and 20M GET. Consisting of the text "Shit. Getting closer" and a picture from some anime, it received around 2400 replies before being deleted 15 hours later. 

* July 17 – Anonymous raids potterforums.com via spam bots with the spoilers for Harry Potter’s seventh book. They manage to close the site down

* June 18 - moot brings back forced Anonymous on /b/ after someone insults him. Many think it is merely a temporary change, and they were right. The forced Anonymous remains in place for just over a month. 

* July 20 - Sometime around 5:40 P.M. EDT, forced anonymous is turned off again. No reason is given at the time, nor is a sticky posted. It is later revealed that moot turned it off at the urging of the other 4chan staffers, all of whom were going to Otakon. 

* July 21 - The Great Deathly Hallows IRL Raid of 2007 - /b/ gets a leak of Harry Potter’s seventh book, obtained from Gaia (Ha!) and proceed to spoiler it for everyone else.
* July 23? - /b/'s background music is changed to a remix of "Chocolate Rain" by Tay Zonday. 

* July 26 – The Fox News Report – HACKERS ON STEROIDS - Fox news makes what is probably most hilariously retarded act of journalism in history. Covering anonymous and internet hackers in ways completely irrelevant, such as showing the footage of an exploding van and that a mother whose son MySpace account got hacked and took to defensive measures such as buying a dog. They coined many memes such as HACKERS ON STEROIDS, INTERNET HATE MACHINE, buy a dog, exploding van and lulz, a corruption of lol.

* July 27 - /b/ raids the shit out of Fox News, spamming MyFoxLA and MyFoxDC forums until the admins deleted them, getting into a completely unprotected FoxNews.com and stealing the personal info 1.5 million users from ZiffDavis.com via a UNIX script, all blaming whilst eBaumsWorld. Other Anonymous IRL raided the Fox News LA Studio by ordering pizzas, male hookers and fast food and many others things. This raid would have happened the same day but, for a weird reason, no new threads could be created on /b/ during that day.

* July 31? - Forced Anon returns on /b/. 

* July 31 - G4's Attack of the Show's plan to talk about Anon at 4chan created forced names/tripcodes of ATOS's guests and anchors for the day on /b/. 

* September – By this time /rs/ - Rapidshare was created.

* September 11 - /b/tard Trey Burba upload the photograph of a pipe bomb on /b/ claiming that he will bomb his school, however he forgot to remove the EXIF data from the camera and he was Doxed. He later claimed everything was a social experiment but the damage was done, the FBI arrested him the next day. He was charged with felony and received three months of house arrest.

 September 21 - Forced Anon is removed from /b/ for some reason, resulting in moot and W.T. Snacks impersonations (among other things). 

* October 1 - 4chan celebrates its 4th birthday with the return of the purple and blue party hats to /b/. A good time is had by all. The yearly commemoration is made by Mac.

* October 19 - 25 – The Caturday Nap - A number of users from Lulznet, previously known as Helldrive IRC, an IRC server that managed to link with many major raid chans of the era (7chan, WTFux, Raidchan, Partyvan.org, 420chan and the Patriotic Nigras) enter the 4chan IRC channel. One of its members, Locutus_of_Lulz, demands that it be moved from its current location on irc.rizon.net to irc.partyvan.org/irc.lulz.net. Their request is not taken seriously and they are banned from the channel in short order. During the exchange, moot apathetically replies “irc is stupid” and “i am gonna go make soup”. Angered, Lulznet beings a DDoS attack against 4chan. The attack is relatively successful, with all of the 4chan servers’ timing out relatively quickly, in response moot simply plugs them out. Simultaneously, Encyclopedia Dramatica attacks Wikichan for the sake of it.

* October 20 – With 4chan off the map, /b/tards flock to 7chan and other sites, as usual. 7chan’s server cannot take this much traffic and wavers in and out of service. 420chan enters partyhard mode to keep the site out of /b/tards.

* October 21 – A 7chan mod decides it’s enough and attaches an upgraded version of partyhard.css to /b/, sending everything to hell. Later they decide to DDOS Lulznet, they fail and Lulznet brings their IRC down, and eventually the whole site, though they almost manage to contain it before their host fixes the problem by nulling them for a while. The p4ch3c0 redirects 7chan to Habbo hotel. /b/tards schedule raids while they wait.

* October 22 - /b/tards and /i/nsurgents gather at Freechan and begin to plan a counter attack. The surge of users puts the site down for fifteen minutes and the OP of the invasion threads gets banned due to fear of Lulznet retaliation. The Lulznet DDOSs are pulled down, 7chan returns but moot is still hanging on to his soup.

* October 24 – They find the Lulznet IRC and DDOS the shit out of them. moot finally runs out of soups and 4chan and /b/ are back with tons of OC, copypasta and a new meme called brb, soup.
* October 26 – No Cussing Club raid - /b/ decided to raid a kids club that, as the name suggests, was against swearing and somehow managed to get the praise of a governor. Simultaneously, new measures are planted on /b/ to stem the tide of newfaggotry. As a result, the possibility of combos was eliminated, the #fortune ability was disabled, and the cancer's hold on the board was reduced somewhat.

* November 5 – The EFG Day Raid – Commemorating the anniversary of V for Vendetta, anon change the classical nigras for a new model resembling the V for Vendetta character. Though extremely unorganized and failing most of its activities, the raid of notorious for managing huge swastigets and other forms of /b/lockade.
* December – moot changes the front page

* December 14 – BRB, compromised - IDIDITFORTHELULZ.net obtains moot’s domain password, hereby taking control of 4chan by having CeLe, owner of Glexia.com, 4chan’s hosting, hand them over. CeLe was a good friend of DIDITFORTHELULZ’s admin, XyriX. Together with his team [Lulz] and his girlfriend Angyl they tried to make a “4chan for the people”. There is a recorded phone conversation where Angyl tries to get a fansign picture of a very angry moot in exchange for giving them the site back. Glexia suspended 4chan’s and teamdouche’s (Angyl’s former team) accounts after they Dox’d Angyl together with Anonymous Borg (Locutus_of_loli, actor in the Caturday Nap). Why they helped, its unknown. moot got the site back after he gave the ransom. I wonder where the pictures are.

* December 21 – The FBI makes reports the arrest of Trey Burba in their website, showing that they really don’t have any idea of how /b/ works.

* December 30 – Hal Turner announces that he is closing his site. In a last moment, 7channers and anons from #insurgency tell the g00ns, who used their actual hacker skills to steal all the data regarding donations and subscribers. It turns out Hal made more money from the former than the latter. Plus that bandwidth totaled way less than he told.

## 2008

* January 1 – His server is hacked once again – This time the hackers finds something interesting, an email exchange with an FBI agent, showing that Hal Turner was in fact Psy-Ops infiltrating the neo nazi movement. Of course, they spread the news like wildfire.

* March 6 – Tom Green gets raided again. This time anons called, asking him to do stuff like a successful gentlemen re-enactment, time-stamping his hand and finally gets an anon who decides to shout FAT NIGGER six times until he’s cut. Around here was when the infamous raid channel #tomgreen was born.

* March 17 – Another Tom Green raid, he befriends a caller on Skype and decides to let him on and call another caller. The first one was cut short because he began to shout FAT NIGGER, now a Tom Green classic. The second one asked him to do a Barrel Roll and the third one put on a Guy Fawkes mask and began to masturbate vigorously. Another called brought up his issue with Drew Baltimore.

* May 2 – /b/-day 2 - Out of curiosity, moot decides to turn /b/ off for one day. The ensuing wave of adrift /b/tards, with no place to go since 7chan was pretending to be bought by 4chan, redirecting to the site, they flocked at /r9k/. There, they discovered that they could impersonate moot, and decided to flood the shit out of everything. As the day progressed more and more /b/tards drifted towards the other boards, mainly /r9k/, /k/, /s/ and /x/.

* May 22 – Operation Jewtube – In response to protests from My Chemical Romance fans regarding criticism of the band, /i/nsurgents from Britchan troll the media by making videos about the protest, adding a final note telling that they were going to kill themselves at the end.

* it's an endless series of reposts, perpetuated by newfags and trolls 
* fail - and its consumption of /b/, has become an unstoppable cancer. 
/b/ has changed." “This is our final mission” was written on the announcements. Before, the title/ has already been renamed /vaporeon/," "/tom/" and "/b/oston." The board was later locked, and unlocked with two stickies. Confused /b/tards though this was it, /b/ was going to be deleted and vowed to at least try to kill the cancer, the cancerous threads became “One last X” threads and other vowed to delete their /b/ folder. However, on other boards, a small text appeared: "today, 6/18. Boston common. park street. 7pm.". By 7PM, a link to an USTREAM video was posted on all the boards. moot successfully tricked all the newfags for 4chan to see.

* June 25 – The SOHH raids – In response of taunts from the JGO (Just Buggin’ Out) forum, /b/ decides to raid the rap site SOHH. They infiltrate the forums, pish accounts and exploit vBulletin until they get admin passwords. They deface the site and eventually DDoS the forums and later the site. The rest of SOHH’s userbase flocked to other site like AllHipHop and /b/ also destroyed them.

* July 6 – By this time, /ib/ and /ip/ were merged back into Oekaki

* July 10 – a /b/tard spamming “Google &#21328” “See results” manages to make /b/ get the swastika appear on Google trends.

* July 11 - The Great Habbo Raid of July 2008 –Following the tradition, plans were already in motion to raid Habbo Hotel once again. This time the action was located in Canada. However many /b/tards raided one day earlier with the excuse of reconnaissance. Though they managed many swastigets the mods eventually retaliated.

* July 12 – /b/tards all over the *chans joined in Habbo Canada to raid. The zerg rush was absolute and very unorganized, even though the veteran nigras made tools for the newfags. The Canadian moderation was more reactionary than the American and banned nigras back and forth. At the same time, in an effort against

* August 7 - 4chan's DNS servers were down and it was not restored until August 11 2008. 

* August 22 – One of the most notorious Tom Green Raids. Tom Green decided to challenge his users to play “the game” – As long as his view count never dropped he would keep taking calls. #tomgreen began to call for /b/lackup on 4chan, 7chan, 420chan and many other sites, and soon the view counts tripled. Botnets were assembled to create fake views and cries of FAT NIGGERS flowed from the phone. Tom Green lost it, shouted “Fuck you, man” at the last caller, torn the phone cable, shouted “PHONES ARE BULLSHIT” whilst leaving and closed the show with a final “See ya, pricks”.

Every single post is wordfiltered to “ROW ROW FIGTH THE POWAH”. A small, clickable fyi link appears under the comment field, which leads to a giant. /b/ proceeds to evacuate the board and raids the fuck out of /trv/ and various other boards. The next stop was /v/, but the raid was met with strong retaliation. Eventually this inspired /v/ tripfag 3 Angled Blue to make the Rage Vs. Cancer comic depicting the civil war, and it got such a rise in popularity that /v/irgins got together and made the popular V-rage flash. 3AB then made a sequel comic and an unfinished conclusion in flash.

* September 16 – /b/tard David Kernel hacks into Sarah Palin’s email by guessing the secret questions, looking to derail his campaign. However he’s scared of being discovered and posts the password on /b/ under the name of Rubico. Subsequently, another user changes the password and posts a screencap, but forgets to censor it. Besides getting labeled a white knight, the account gets the password changed a third time, but due to Yahoo policy it gets locked. Rubico essentially showed /b/ all the information necessary to get v&, including his email, his American Proxy.    moot gets called into court to testify against David.

* September 17 – Rubico posts his story of how he did it, it immediately becomes a copypasta. The news get on the old media and an Internet poll held by Fox News’s host Greta Van Susteren over the issue, asking what the users though about the incident, if it was a harmless prank or a political move. Anonymous was aware of this and immediately clicked the prank option. However when the polls turned to 67% in favour of the prank the host claimed they got hacked. After the show was over they rigged the poll so you could no longer select the prank option. 4chan then proceeded to spam the comments section. A thread erupts laughing at how moot will get v& because of it, and moot responds by changing the title to “/b/ - DESPICABLE, SLIMMY, SCUMMY” with the subtitle “Remix”. He then embedded a remix of Row Row Fight the Powah.

* September 20 - Rubico gets arrested and his house is investigated. It ends up he’s the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative Mike Kernell. /b/ attempts to DDOS and Raid Bill O’Reily, who was dissing the site at the time but they fail to incite any reaction.

* December 13 – The day /b/ died - /b/ and a coalition of *chans and related raids AnonTalk during Operation AntFuck, fed off with his endless spam. At the same time /b/ gets spammed to death by Raidchan with KORAX > YOU and KAYLA > YOU. Somehow, this actually makes most people leave and those who stayed claimed that the boards quality got better.

* December 27 – Prelude to Boxxy - 4chan was due for unknown reasons, and on 7chan’s /b/, now roaring with 4chan’s /b/tards, a video of a strangely tantalizing teenager was embedded under the name of FOAR 4DD1 FRUM BOXXY.

## 2009

* January 1 – The great No Cussing Club Raid – /b/tards chan-wide IRL raid McKay, creator of the No Cussing Club by sending him porn magazines, pizza and death threats. On 4chan, /b/ was back, and the boxxy video was the subject of many “You rage, you lose” and “You fall in love, you lose” threads. Opinions on boxxy where divided, and conflicted, submerging the board in a flame war. Enraged newfags and oldfags spammed her comments section and days later boxy closed her Youtube channel, boxybabe.

* January 7 – Boxxy discovers her fans and decides to lurk /b/. There, she posted two pics of herself, but was called out as a fake, to prove her pictures; she made a second account, boxybabee, and uploaded a third video acknowledging /b/. At that point, everything went to hell.

* January 10 – Operation: Clampdown - Everything was going to hell. About 50% of the threads on /b/ where about boxxy. Pissed of, the “faction”, those who did not care, planned to DDOS the site the next day.

They privatized all her videos and uploaded one claiming that Boxxy will never upload a video again, holding her d0x hostage. This would be considered a win, however they proceeded to brag about their deeds on the comment section and nobody liked that. 

* January 19 - Realizing this, they spread her d0x and uploaded a second video attempting, and failing, to claim that they did not do it for fame.

* January 20 – Seeing that their infamy wouldn’t do anything else than rise, they decided to shut down the organization and revert the account due to troll’s remorse.

* January 21 – McKay’s father, Brent Hatch’s email gets hacked. It’s discovered that in fact, No Cussing Club was the parent’s idea and profits from it. Leaking this info effectively ruined the club.

* January 28 - "After four months of being ad-free, we're running some ad tests. We ask that you bear with us as we filter out the shitty ads and see what works. Also, please don't block them, and be sure to click those that interest you. Thanks!"

Europe, who had a high school massacre in Germany two days before, responds immediately. He gets arrested and his house is searched. He claimed that everything was a joke.

* April 11 – Once again, /b/ decides to raid AnonTalk for a third tame, continuing the operation.

* April 16 – Tom Green gets Sushi. He has a bunch of friends come to the house to party, with no Skype on the plans. Meanwhile, a tripfag under the name of BBQ orders 450 dollars’ worth of Sushi and every anon waits expectantly. Nothing happens until the end of the show, his door rings and we see a small cart with enough Sushi to feed a small family for a week comes in. However it seems he did not pay for the Sushi, because he’s seen eating a Hamburger at the end of the show.

* April 17 – Kimmo makes a news post declaring that he won’t spam any longer. Anonymous declares victory. Two days later he goes full circle and the spam starts again.

* April 27 - 4chan related groups successfully hacked Time 2009's Person of the Year contest by rigging the candidates’ names with mARBLECAKEALSOTHEGAME. Time refuses to shallow pride and declare the poll valid, inviting moot to a Time magazine event, sparking a meme in the process.

* May 5 - /b/ DDOS’s itself - /b/ and /r9k/ grinded to a halt by DDOS, everyone suspects 711chan is to blame. However it was later discovered that users downloaded an image that contained a DDOS script without realizing. The attack continued an entire week.

* May 19 - YouTube Porn Day - /b/ - "...what would happen if ALL of us upload porn on YouTube non-stop?". /b/-tards planned the raid by uploading the porn in private videos with the tags marblecake, and released them all in the same day with the tag Marblecake. Even though the operation started too early due to timelines, Youtube was still clogged with porn, creating the memes “I’m 12 years old and what is this” and Marblecake.

* May 29 - moot posts a sticky called "Re:spam" with an image titled crockofshit.png 

* June 1 - /b/ title changed to "Twilight Appreciation Station - The darkest place on the internet -- for vampire compatriots"

* June 18 – A year after the events of the old /b/ day, /b/’s title changed to "you forgot - it was your final mission nothing will save you now." On the other boards, the meet up was scheduled at Washington Square, and this time, moot was there.

The script uploads a rainbow of coloured images of the main character of A Clockwork Orange. The attack spread to every damn board and lasted until July 8.

* July 12 - moot makes a global announcement stating that he might use Twitter "(ugh)" for site updates in addition to other stuff. (Despite the initial feelings about twitter, he eventually learns to enjoy it.) . On the same day, /b/tards find a messageboard, “iheartboxxy”, a small group of users found two videos of Boxxy filmed by her friends attending the 2009 Spring California Thespin Festival. Regarding themselves as a council, one of the members got d0x and /b/ threatened to raid him if they did not show the videos. Eventually the admin of the website obliged and uploaded them.

* July 25 - BoxxPeace – Sequel to BoxxMeet. A group of anonymous stalkers use her d0x to meet up at her neighborhood and bring her gifts. Given that this is the second time it happens, they found a chair on her front gates. They rang the bell but no one answered. They left some flowers in front of the gates with the word “Anon”. They later found her ex-boyfriend, Dan Birlen, though Boxxy never appeared. Over the months a new wave of pictures would appear, obtained by “Calif4nia”, an user of Killwebs.com, who got them by flirting with a friend of Boxxy, Niki, for months. He watermarked them with his site’s logo and blurred them. However, anonymous managed to fix the pictures and doxed callif4nia, whose team later shut down Killwebs.com.

* July 27 – AT&T blocks 4chan - moot attempts to reduce damage from having AnonTalk DDOS them with dire consequences: AT&T blocks 4chan's /r9k/ and /b/ more specifically the img.4chan.org sub domain was blocked. The entire site rises in arm in retaliation, but the matter is soon cleared and the block lifted. Moot used the opportunity to talk about Internet censorship

* September - Gamespot.com hosted a tournament, where its users voted to decide who the greatest video game character of all time is. 4chan decided to trash this party. Anonymous decided to have Duke Nukem, Little mac and /b/ubble & /b/bobble come out at the top. Especially /b/u/b/ & /b/o/b/. At the first round of the tournament, bub & bob were against the mighty master chief. Master Chief was no match for bub & bob, since the Gamespot community wasn't prepared for a raid such as this. Much lulz was had, as bub & bob, a game that most people haven't heard of defeated master chief. bub & bob defeated sonic easily in the next round, and faced Samus in round 3. It was an incredibly tight match. Hackers from both sides pulled all-nighters. As a result, bub & bob won with 53% of the votes. Sadly, the Gamespot admins disqualified bub & bob because they caught 5 specific people who submitted 16K votes. bub & bob won the battle, but Samus had won the war. Due to the raid, the word 4chan was banned from the Gamespot forums. The Gamespot community now refers to 4chan as mordor. 

* August 20 – Tom Green runs another Skype show, with an anon offering to sings the FAT NIGGER song, the second anon puts on a charade for five minutes until finally fapping on camera, and the third anon gurgles cum on the air.

* December 10 – The Boxxy videos get taken down by somebody named Lia Dawson, claiming that Boxxy is a registered trademark of the Lia Dawson & Frank Dawson Network. It was later discovered that Boxxy was an actual registered trademark of Oudipo, Inc. and that they renewed the trademark on December 2009. However, user ChrissyRin ousted the scammers for what they were, hoping to attain money from the Youtube videos of Boxxy and other 20 Youtube accounts.

## 2010

* February - A sticky was created on /b/, where moot asked what he should mention for his presentation for TED Talks. The thread received over 12K posts. moot described anonymous to a bunch of confiscates in 70 different countries (wait until all those people go on 4chan, realizing that 4chan is dead and full of porn) on TED Talks. He claimed 4chan was dying due to the movement towards internet privacy. moot also reviled that he moved out of his mom's house and back to college. 
* February - Massive Q and A threads on /a/, /jp/, and /r9k/. Moot created a formspring page for Q and A things but it was flooded with 20,000 messages. Around 2012 he quietly replaced the formspring page with the 4chan FAQ. 

* February 4 - Verizon users started experiencing problems loading 4chan. Soon moot confirmed with Verizon customer support that 4chan was blocked on purpose. Verizon took a week to "resolve" the situation 

* February 21 - 200M GET on /b/ featured an image of Ninetails, a Pokemon. On that same date, moot implemented post number truncation in response to the Bateman/Doubles Guy posts on /b, but they simply moved to /a/ and /v/ to spread this cancer. 

* February 23 - a clue was featured on Jeopardy in a category entitled 'Internet' containing a reference to 4chan.org. moot posted an image about the broadcast. 

* February 26 – HARMONY - A /v/irgin delves into the depths of Adult Swim’s flash section and finds a single game – Robot Unicorn Attack. The /v/irgin, felt something weird… something new. For the first time he actually liked a game. So he went to /v/ to tell the news.

* February 27 –Robot Unicorn Attack invades the entirety of /v/ and leaks into /a/, /jp/, /co/, /m/. /tg/, /k/, /x/ and /mu/. Many tripfags contributed, MFGreth1 added it on wiki recommended games list, Gay Purple Man, began streaming the game, BaconShota made #robotunicornattack, lordofhet started a group on Steam. Hundreds of /v/irgins emailed moot asking him to embed the RUA theme – Always by Erasure – on /v/. And he complied. Surprisingly, the game wasn’t even mentioned on /b/, something the /b/tards didn’t like. This event, in its own small way, change the way /v/ reacted towards games, from the hate bandwagon to actually admitting what games they liked. This would be a perfect reflection of the cultural changes 4chan went through during 2010.

* February 28 - "Over the past 48 hours 4chan's formspring page has gotten over 12,000 questions, and I've received over 3,000 e-mails. Many thanks to everyone who submitted a question, and sent me a message! I was able to respond to a few hundred e-mails and had hoped to start answering questions on formspring, but it seems that the number of questions broke the page. Once that's sorted out, I'll sift through them and answer as time allows. Thanks again for all of the support!" - However this fix never happened due to various reasons.

Later that night, Leonhardt uploaded a response video in which her father warned attackers that they would found proclaiming “YOU DUN GOOFED”.

* July 15 - Anonymous soon uncovered her personal information including phone number, address and her Twitter account. People soon began flooding the Leonhardt’ household with prank calls and hate e-mails. In a Stickam video uploaded on July 15th, Jessi is seen answering the phone during one of the prank calls. Following the relentless waves of harassment carried out by the trolls, Jessi posted a tearful response video on YouTube, in which her father Gene Leonhardt suddenly comes into the shot and delivers an angry rant.

* July 18 – Gawker reports that Jessi slaughter has been put under police protection. Anon rejoices.

* July 19 – Adrian Chen, covering the Jessi Slaughter events made an article called “The Art of Trolling: Inside a 4chan Smear Campaign.” After outlining 4chan’s plan of attack against Dahvie Vanity with screenshots and links, Chen linked to a chatroom, daring readers to troll it. Enraged, /b/ set out to take down Gawker’s main servers around noon on July 19th. When the site did not go down, an attack against Adrian Chen was launched. Gawker posted an article detailing the entire plot, stating that they were not afraid.

* July 21 - /b/ is told that Jessi Slaughter will appear on Good Morning America! the following day. /b/ panics, factions rise, one wanting to spam /b/ to keep off potential newfags and one wanting to make /b/ the complete opposite of what will be reported on the TV. The later faction won. Operation /b/ipolar begins.

* July 22 – Operation /b/ipolar - /b/'s rules change, along with embedded music and a new sticky thread in "honor" of, ABC's Good Morning Coverage of Jessi Slaughter. /b/ was ready to for the income of new users thanks to Operation /b/ipolar, but in the end it never happened, Jessi wizens up and doesn’t mention 4chan.

* July 23 – In the end, Good Morning America! did mention 4chan in the night shift airing, causing /b/ to panic again. But before it could re-start Operation /b/ipolar, a massive wave of spam crashes /b/. /b/tards flee to /a/ and later /x/, who welcomes them with open, ghostly arms.

* November 14 - Operation Overlord. A butthurt Tumblr user makes a request of invasion on /b/, but is shunned off by most as it was a personal army request. Still it garnered enough users to catch the attention of the Tumblr user’s that browsed 4chan. It prompted them to start Operation Overkitten, flooding /b/ with actual pictures of kittens and the phrase “What is air”  . In response, /b/ attempts to DDOS Tumblr but fails, only taking the front page down. Tumblr declares victory and eventually, in the victory flood of /b/, a somewhat clear-headed user of /b/ proposes that, since 4chan is predominantly male, and Tumblr is predominantly female, should have sex with each other. Thus, 4chumblr is born, and a surprising amount of Tumblr girls began to post pics of themselves in you love you lose and tits threads.

* November 17 – Operation: Black Rage - In an urge to stop meme culture from going mainstream, /b/ starts making “race guy” comic, racist variants of rage guy, in hopes of getting Hot Topic to stop selling t-shirts.

* November 25 – Boxxy returns with a new video and posts it on Unichan.

* November 27 – Kimmo brings the site back again for a third time, this time even more restricted as before. Same old, same old.

After so many times having /x/ handle /b/ refugees, /b/ enacts rule 43 – Due to their always helpful, although sometimes reluctant, attitude /x/ has had toward /b/ all these years and specially due the events of the PUDDI invasion, /x/ will not be raided anymore. This didn’t do much however, by the time this happened /x/ was already through the last stages of terminal cancer due to local tripfags.

* October 26 - "I'm so fresh you can suck my nuts" is stickied on /b/. 

* November 4 – moot responds to the “Occupy Wall Street” movement by hacking the shit out of /b/’s CSS.

* November 8 - /new/ is (accidentally?) revived. No news posts are made, rules given, or mods on it. Title is "Yotsuba Image Board," the default title given to new boards; seems to be a mix of /co/ and /sp/ users with a healthy blend of racism thrown in. Posts from January still made up over half the board. Deadmau5 appears on /mu/ in two sticky threads. The off-topic posts in /mu/ intensify.

* November 10 - Moot adds /r9k/ - ROBOT9001, /pol/ - Politically Incorrect, and /hc/ - Hardcore. All three previous board (/r9k/, /new/ and /hc/). Creates /diy/ - Do It Yourself. 

* November 12 - Official Chrome extension released and Firefox extension updated. 

* November 13 - 4chan suffered a sustained DDoS onslaught by an unknown person or entity. After the onslaught moot installed Cloudflare. Tumblr suspected. 

* November 16 - DDOS dies down 

* November 17 - Moot has a sticky in /g/. /r9k/ gets spoiler tags thanks to Tage Heyn and people (s)talk about Shii. /v/ becomes El Vidyo and gets Hispanic background music. 

* November 20 - Moot tries to make pages load more quickly by changing how captchas load. Naturally, this makes captchas stop working altogether. Quick reply/Noko/All non-official 4chan applications stop working and the submit button grays out for a lot of people. I link moot to the thread and after he posts, the thread explodes with people bitching and moot undoes the changes after the thread hits 200 replies about an hour and a half later. (/g/21167645).

* November 26 - /sp/ - Ship Posting day – moot completely loses it and changes the name of /sp/ to WE NBA NOW!!!!!!!!!, with the subtitle of “our body is ready”. He proceeds to sticky random off-topic threads and ban users with random tags such as [USER WAS RITHMYCALLY SLAPPED FOR THIS POST] or [USER WAS HORSEPLAYED FOR THIS POST] and changing his name to mootdusky. This is due to the state of /sp/ reaching critical mass; moot pretty much gave up on the board.

## 2012

* February - moot quietly opens /hm/ to the public after enough requests. 

* February 4 – /v/ beats Reddit at Tribes Ascend, becomes /v/ - Well-coordinated and heavily practiced Reddit team beaten by a rag-tag group of /v/irgins run by a furry and a BR with 140 ping and gets GAL男宣言 (Galo Sengen) embedded as background music. /v/ is split into /v/ and /vg/. It is now impossible to get dubs on /v/. The /int/ board is occupied by Russian channers from 2ch.so due to a DDoS attack by pro-government groups. 

* February 14 – During Valentine’s Day, moot announces that he is planning to add up to 15 boards, including one to contain the rising brony phenomenon. Later, he reestablished forced anon on /b/ using a 24 hours ID system, essentially making one anonymous without being anonymous. From this day on, the quality of /b/ seems to ameliorate, albeit slowly.

* February 17 - Since the cartoon series My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic becomes massively popular, surpassing its /co/ boundaries and adopting a pseudo culture under the name of bronies. moot creates /mlp/ - My Little Pony in order to stop the massive flood of My Little Pony threads on 4chan. Many people though /mlp/ would go the way of Aprils Fur’s Day, but it never happened. Some bronies would rather create /b/reads: Threads outside /mlp/ that are essentially a circlejerk between trolls and tripfags, to the point of sharing contacts.

* March 7 - /b/’s header is changed to the words "NO SCRUBS ALLOWED" and below that "SEE ABOVE". The song “No Scrubs” by TLC is played in the background. :stopmusic: faggotry ensues. The layout is returned to normal on the next day.

* July 6 – moot writes a note talking about bandwidth usage, extensions and asks both add-on developers and users to be reasonable with update intervals.

* August – With 4chan’s one billionth post looming in, moot replies to two threads on /b/ with his admin tag on. The threads quickly turn into a Questions and answers session between the long forsaken /b/tards and their admin years after the last news post and contact with the staff. Many tears were shed.

* August 8 – After 4chan’s billionth post, moot posts the first news post in four years. He reopens /q/ as /q/ - 4chan Discussion and states that he plans to start a series of Prime ministers Q/A threads, because he feels he lost touch with the community. Following some suggestions on /q/, avatarfagging becomes a banned offense. There was also a failed attempt at allowing minors to browse 4chan, but was quickly replaced with MINERS because of the huge negative backslash from the community.
* With time /q/ is flooded by users from /a/ and /v/, the two boards with the most traffic after /b/, known to be notoriously reactionary. Not long after that, most mods are taken to /v/ to deal with the recent wave of shitposting and the deprecation of /v/ culture. /a/ users keep complaining about undesirable anime threads like Naruto, and how they shouldn’t be on /a/. The staff seems to have divided opinions and shift between deleting threads and leaving them be. The following debates backslash when trolls begin to crapflood /a/ with Naruto threads, whilst the rest of /a/ bandwagoned against them. Eventually moot stepped in and clarified that Naruto is /a/ content.

* August 10 - moot hacks /a/’s CSS and wordfilters every post to JIBUN WOOOOOOO. He embedded the first opening of Code Geass on the first page.

* August 13 – Dub the Dew – 4chan gets hold of Mountain Dew’s new naming contest, and together with Reddit hijacks it, making names like “Fapple”, “Diabeetus” and “Hitler Did Nothing Wrong” appear on the top. Bronies also join the game, attempting to get Applejack to the top, but they only manage to appear on second place. Later, the site was hacker and the banner “Mtn Dew salutes the Israeli Mossad for demolishing 3 towers on 9/11!” appeared, together with a rickroll and a pop up of “le 9gag are legion”. Mountain Dew later admits defeat and suspends the contest.

* August 30 – 4chan attempts to get Taylor Swift to play on a deaf school my hijacking the Taylor Swift on Campus promotion, where the winner gets 10000$ in prizes and Taylor Swift playing a gig at their place. 4chan votes the Horace Mann School for the deaf for first place, with an overwhelming 10000. Many anons joined the cause because they knew it’s actually possible to play music for the deaf. Taylor Swift, however had other plans. She convinces the sponsors to disqualify the school and donates the 10000$ herself. And it doesn’t stop there, he also get the sponsors to donate themselves, along with three other non-profit companies, and gives ticket for her next gig to all the members of the school. Ending with a whopping 60000$ in donations.

* September 3 – moot announces on a news post that he will start working where he left off on the last news post of 2008. He announces that on 09/09 Janitor applications will open again.

* September 5 – On a news post, moot announces that KING JAFFE JOFFER, along with the coder of the Yotsuba Catalog, Desuwa, made a major overhaul of the HMTL5 code, created the inline extensions and added a 4chan JSON API. All threads are now rendered in JSON too. Joffer also ports the Firefox extension to Google Chrome. The inline extensions are published on Github, in hopes that the coding community will give suggestions to make it better.

* September 9 – After a long time, janitor applications open for a period of 24 hours. moot reports receiving 7500 applications and will oversee them within the following months.

* September 12 – moot opens the first official Q/A on /q/ a la prime minister questions.

* September 18 – moot announces the start of the 4chan pass, thanks to suggestions of /q/ users. It allows users to bypass reCAPTCHA for a year, paying 20 dollars. This is simply because moot doesn’t support the concept of ongoing donations nor donations rallies, partly because he dislikes receiving without giving.

* September 28 – moot makes a news post clarifying some doubts and questions about the 4chan pass

* October 1 – 4chan turns nine years, with the sixth consecutive commemoration from Mac.

* October 16 – After a load of consecutive epic thread happening lately, a mod stickies a loop from the anime Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! With the song Pull Over from Trina embedded on it. /b/ rages on weaboos and raids /a/ for it.

* October 19 - チルノのパーフェクトさすう教室 - Cirno's Perfect Math Class ENGLISH SUB is stickied on /b/. Guess the mods are back at sticking shit again. Just like the old times. 

* October 24 - #baldforbieber – Anonymous decides to troll Justin Bieber fans by spreading fake news of cancer, shooping a picture of Bieber asking people to bald their heads. It’s surprisingly successful and in result many lulz were had, a lot of media coverage.

* November 08 – On a /q/ thread about /mlp/, http://thereisnosanity.com/posters/statistics.php is posted by a pony shitposter, leading 4chan to question if organized shitposting is actually real.

* November 09 - /g/ begins to investigate. They eventually come to the conclusion that the website’s owner, Seff, is in some form a leading figure within the shitposters. The plot thickens; users panic and the mods start get involved. On a second thread, Seff himself comes in to clarify the situation: He is building a system to track the shitposters, their threads and their posts to later email them to moot. Still investigation shed some light on him and proved he shitposter on /a/, There is no sanity is nothing more than Seff’s personal nick on the Internet, whit sites like his Youtube channel and myanimelist page (Though thereisnosanity is a common phrase, there’s a chance, albeit low, that the users are unrelated). The situation got many boards in a panic and Seff was doxed and raided IRL. Later on the same thread moot posted screenshots from Seff’s emails, confirming that Seff was a shitposter that ratted everyone out by emailing moot when he realized there was a leak. Still, He wasn’t forgiven.
* Whether this was a clever act of damage control for when the site was discovered, or Seff was genuinely scared of being discovered, is yet to be seen. 

* November 10 – Operation Kinder - /b/ attempts to get the unshooped picture of the Osama Beard kid on a new Ukrainian Kinder chocolate. They manage to get it to the second place. On the pony organized shitposting issue, According to a shitposter, the dox aren't from Seff, pushing the theory of damage control one step further.

* November 11 – The get “Victor” on the first place, with help from Funnyjunk and a lot of Organization, reaching over 10000 votes and over 15000 the next day – Regarding the pony issue This image proves that Seff was indeed in a ruse. 

* November 12 – An uncut version of http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apPYRUxSJ2c get’s stickied on /b/, ponies rage site-wide. /b/ rejoices, for it’s the first time the mods do something right.

* November 13 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DW31upNEEg get’s stickied on /b/. Nigga that’s kawaii. Kinder Ukraine resets the votecount and takes Victor out of the contest, /b/ gets it on the top again, only for the votecount to be reset again.

* November 18 - The ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) meme becomes widespread in record time.  It was born out of the Finnish imageboard Yilauta and overran 4chan, Reddit, Tumblr and Facebook in a single day.

Two other stickies related to the so-called end of the world are posted on /b/ and /x/; the former was comedic and featured an autoplaying video of R.E.M.'s song "It's the End of the World As We Know It," while the latter was opened for more serious discussion. 

* December 25 – Christmas faggot hat day

* January 7 - #cutforbieber – Anonymous decides to do another joke on believers, in response and uses the opportunity brought by a leaked picture of Justin holding a joint to spread #cutforbieber, urging people to cut themselves. However /b/ did nothing besides the original idea so the GNAA took over. An user made a fake news story of a girl dying from the act.

* January 30 - #boobs4bieber - /b/ decides to attempt a new Bieber scam by editing tits out of jailbait pictures and posting them on Twitter. But this time the attack is reported by the media and rejected by /b/tards. They complain that Bieber is an overused target and the attack simply fails to take off. Meanwhile, /mlp/ is renamed to WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW? Due to the reaction of the board towards the main character becoming an alicorn, for the sake of new toys.

* March 31 – moot confirms /s4s/ is here to stay.

* April 1 – On April 1 12:00 PM moot adds s4s – Shit 4chan Says under the header of “Unlike the other new boards, this is being added on a permanent basis. If it doesn't pan out or goes unused, you should probably check your privilege.” The board gets two stickies – a 5555 Dubs GET and another saying “Post in this thread to have your privilege checked” Later the full joke kick’s in and moot changes the format and CSS to make it look like Reddit. On both /s4s/ and /b/ a popup about AdultCatFinder appears. A mod checks everyone’s privilege on the second sticky and an empty thread is stickied on /b/.

* April 3 - /s4s/ becomes an official 4chan board, becoming a rules-less yellow board under the title of “Shitposting 4n Steroids”. But it’s not listed on the main page and many people complain about the name change.

* May – Recent crack downs on the shitposting of /sp/ and /tv/ (Two long-forgotten, but still alive, boards) lead to many users outright rebelling against the moderation team. On one side, users form /tv/ have long been complaining about constantly celebrity waifu threads, which could take as much as half the board. /sp/’s off-topic posting has been increasing exponentially since 2010. The upset and banned users started spreading images and signing their posts with a hashtag #freesp or #freetv. Though it’s agreed that /tv/ has no holding ground to claim celebrity threads to be allowed, moot has agree that he would consider allowing certain classic /sp/ threads such as power level and current even threads.

* May 12 – moot opens the third Q/A, fucks with the CSS by forgetting a “ and jokes with /s4s/ by giving it comic sans.

Immediately, users went to /q/ to complain and ask for help. Users from banned countries where even restricted from posting on /q/. /int/erns, already heavily dissatisfied with the staff because they let a completely power tripping janitor ran amok in the board, completely rebelled against the board. /ref/, a board for /int/ “refugees”, became the base of operations for the spammers. Determined to make enough ruckus to reverse the changes, /int/erns and /ref/ugees got hold of every communist pic they had and began spamming /int/ with claims of revolution, determined to make the entire board red. The spam proved to much for the /int/ janitor to handle and he stopped deleted threads. /int/ continued spamming the board for the rest of the day. By the next day, everything was back to normal, except the janitor was nowhere to be seen. For the first time in months, /int/ rejoiced. Meanwhile, moot celebrates the anniversary of the Boston fail meet up by re-enacting the old /b/-day. This time, however, instead of a meet up on the other board, he starts two contests on /q/, one about rotating banners (Those things you see on the top page that always have the 4chan tittle) and House Ads (Replacements for the adspace when there are no current adds running)

The OP urges everyone to vote for a "Charles Z". "Charles" quickly reached 1st place, and on the 19th, the radio station shut down the content for "being compromised". This was followed by other attempts to make "Charles" meet a pop star - rigging a contest by New York City's Z100 to meet Selena Gomez on the 21st, and being followed the next day by another raid on a contest by the same station to meet the Jonas Brothers. 

* July 19 - /b/ twitter-bombs UFC fighter "War Machine." Raiders insult his family, send him pizzas, post him in the gay section of Craigslist, and almost fool him into deleting system 32. As a result War Machine became enraged and repeatedly punched himself in the head. 

* July 27 – A harsh critic from GameInformer journalist Martin Beer makes Indie games developer Phil Fish ragequit Twitter and cancel his newest game, Fez 2. /v/ celebrates by making tons of OC, including a new /v/ Sings and countless Youtube videos.

* July 31 – A tripfag under the code !DwgeSpOOKY claiming to be an ex-janitor disgruntled with the state of the staff leaks /j/ - janitor info on /sp/, including the janitor application acceptance mail, list of the #janiteam IRC members, many logs and screens of /j/. The moderation teams goes into lockdown mode in record time and deletes all mentions of it on /q/, /b/ and /sp/. His leaks and accounts on the team show that the janitors operate on a hit or miss basis and aren’t allowed to express opinions or discuss site culture. He hypothesized such things led to outburst of mass deletion on /jp/ and /tv/ in order to express their frustration. Many users assumed that /q/ poster MQrB8x2X was a janitor based on these leaks.

* August 13 – Naruto Day - /a/’s elitism finally goes to far when they dox a 4chan mod who posted on /q/ telling them to stop complaining about moderation. Moot retaliates turning /a/ into N/a/RUTO CONFIRMED BEST ANIME CHINESE CARTOON OF ALL TIME, with the subtitle BELIEVE IT (also dubs are better than subs) and stickying a bunch of Naruto thread. /a/ goes berzek and begins spamming CP on some threads, forcing the mods to take it down..

* August 15 - /b/ 500m GET: “poland has best prostitutes, i fucked plenty in london. i hope one is ur wife someday fag 500 mil get” moot makes a headliners called “I for one salute our new polish prostitute overlords”. Considered a failGET by some.

* August 26 – Thanks Australia – Congratulating Kojima on his 50st birthday, /v/ sends him over a hundred postcards. However, Kojima thanks Australia instead of 4chan, because the sender was Australian. moot considered this funny and renamed the board to “/v/ - Australia” with the subtitle “T-Thanks Kojima-Sama!”

He later makes a sticky on /s4s/ where he discusses porn threads on the board, both him and the community decide they should be banned.

He adds a much needed ban log 4chan ban log. Finally, in an act that will live in infamy, he makes sage invisible after almost 10 years of the feature. R.I.P in pieces, Sageman.

* September 27 – AWA 2013 starts 

* September 28 - The aforementioned 10th Anniversary 4chan panel takes place at AWA. As with previous cons. /jp/ changes its title to " /jp/ - Weaponized /a/” with the subtitle “Home of ``Misunderstood Geniuses''. /jp/ watches the 4chan panel on Youtube, and this is ground zero for the shitstorm as the board got hijacked by /b/tards when moot mentioned it as “Weaponized /a/”

It includes notes, poems, artwork, and all posts by namefag UTV since July 1. UTV Archiver was later referenced as “The most autistic user in the history of 4chan”

* December 25 – faget hats, Christmas edition.

## 2014

The OP of the post received ten thousand replies, doubling the previous record set by a namefag called 'eternal samefig' on the same board, who vowed to reply to his post until 4chan died. The sticky is still up as of January 30 and has 10892 replies.

Smaller than .gifs, this new encode is meant to replace them, however moot decided to limits .webm upload to files with not audio streams, 2048*2048 resolution, 120 seconds duration and 3MB file size.

In the aftermath, /jp/ outs janitor Saegrimir!SHIELD as one and /a/ antagonizes the mods until they come to post and doxes janitor BigN.
