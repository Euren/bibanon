[This reposted archive](https://twitter.com/YotsubaSociety/status/612719116571529216) from the Yotsuba Society contained every single panel ever given by Moot. We've posted this to [the Internet Archive for safekeeping.](https://archive.org/details/Moot-AVideoArchiveOf4chansFounder)

Moot's panels over the years are incredibly important to the study of 4chan history (since he is the first anon and the longest running anon)

They also need to have transcriptions made, to make long 2 hour rambling panels more accessible for future archivists (and translators).

Later panels were recorded and livestreamed via 4chan's YouTube account (those should be uploaded too just in case).
