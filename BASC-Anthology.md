* [Wi-Fi Planet - The Open Source WRT54G Story](http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3562391) - Nowadays, every single $60 Wi-Fi router worth it's salt runs some form of embedded Linux, and most of them can be modified to provide amazing new features once restricted to $600 corporate routers. But how did that happen? It began when Linksys was forced to open-source the firmware of the WRT54G Router family: and the most beloved router of all time, and an embedded codebase for the ages, was born.

But the codebase lives on in almost every single embedded Linux router: and even runs on things that aren't routers.

### Back to the 1980s

Websites that enshrine the legacy of the 1980s, as seen through childhood's rose-tinted eyeglasses. These became popular as websites or flash animations in a retro chic during the 2000s, when such children became college students, discovered many people like them, and looked back fondly on those idyllic days. And now I myself look back fondly at the days when I could just surf the internet and hear these amazing stories, or just dirty language (which really does appeal to tweens).

* [AVGN](http://cinemassacre.com/category/avgn/) - Still keeping the tradition of retro gaming alive to this day, with the Angry Video Game Nerd swearing like a sailor.

* [VGDC](http://www.videogamedc.com/) - In memory of Randy Solem, a man who made sprite flash movies into an art form.
* [Mr Breakfast's Cereal Knowledgebase](http://www.mrbreakfast.com/cereal_home.asp) - In the 1980s, children were screaming for Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs, cereal puffs that were little more than candy for breakfast.

## Weird Japan

While Japan is attempting to promote "Cool Japan" in it's latest Tokyo Olympics, it will always be haunted by the spectre of "Weird Japan", a strange side of it's culture that is an effect of it's uniqueness, and age advancement (in terms of both technology and aging population).

* [Wikipedia - Honne and Tatemae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_tatemae) - The Japanese maintain a dual persona for public and private, and as a result have developed a unique concept of Honne and Tatemae. That inner meaning is often suppressed while in society, and only bubbles to the surface when drunk, shameless, or in anonymous textboards (such as 2channel).
* [Japangasm - Cats vs water Bottles](https://japangasm.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/cats-vs-bottles-part-1/) - [Danny Choo - Don't Cat](http://www.dannychoo.com/en/post/26447/Japan+Cat+Repellent.html) - Cat repelling Water Bottles? Who believes in this? Anyway, it's not like any cat cares at all.

But all bubbles will pop, and these wonderous tourist destinations now sit overgrown by vines.

## LP Archive

A "Let's Play" is a playthrough of a video game that is recorded and shared with the public. Although no better known for the numerous Youtube LPs (and in fact many of the LPs on the archive are in video format), there are also LPs using screenshots and text, or even hybrids of both formats. The LP Archive saves interesting LPs from Something Awful. This is a collection of what we think is the cream of the crop. Obviously there are more than what we have here, so browse the catalog for yourself.

* [Animal Crossing](http://lparchive.org/Animal-Crossing/) - Not your daddy's Animal Crossing.
   * Animal Crossing is a series of games where the player settles in a small town. You can pick fruit, dig up fossils, catch insects, fish, and interact with the locals. All of your efforts are to repay your crippling debt to the local friendly store owner, Tom Nook, after which he expands your house without your consent and charges you an even higher debt. If you play for long enough, you may be able to one day pay off your debt and fill the museum with every fossil, fish, insect, and painting in the game. Sounds peaceful and boring? **It won't be.**

* [Civilization 4](http://lparchive.org/Civilization-4/) - Extremely detailed historical narrative.
   * Civilization is a historical 4X game, where you can take control of a civilization as a famous leader, both of which gives certain advantages. However, because the game allows the player to control the course of human history for 6000 years, the historical narrative isn't as interesting as it real history. This LP brings in the military campaigns, revolutions, political intrigue, technological advancements, family lineages, and cultural development that makes human history so interesting. Sadly, the LP stops abruptly in the early 1700's with many questions left unanswered. 

* [Dwarf Fortress - Boatmurdered](http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/) - Even crazier than your average game of DF
   * Dwarf Fortress is a game where you take 7 dwarfs and some meager supplies into the wilderness, and after braving every possible danger, from carp to giant colossi to goblins to miasma to insane dwarfs, you will have the greatest underground fortress in all the lands. Of course, it takes a lot of experience and just as much luck to even get a minor farming community running before you get overrun by kobolds. As the DF community knows though, _losing is fun_. This particular playthrough can be said to encompass everything that saying represents.

* [Gazillionaire Deluxe](http://lparchive.org/Gazillionaire-Deluxe/) - The rise of a trading empire
   * I honestly have no idea what Gazillionaire Deluxe is. It looks like a crappy Flash game or a simple game from the 90's. Regardless, this is still a great rags-to-riches story.

* [Half Life 2](http://lparchive.org/Half-Life-2/) - I guarantee this is actually HL2
   * Spoiler alert, this isn't actually Half Life 2, it's Half Life ~~Episode 3~~ 1. 

* [Oregon Trail](http://lparchive.org/Oregon-Trail-%28by-Chewbot%29/) - Get ready for your Mornin' Cornin'
   * The Oregon Trail was a staple for children from the 90's. As the name suggests, it's about the Oregon Trail, and the hardships the travelers of it faced. However, it can be safely assumed that no family had to endure the hardships the Neckebard went through.

* [Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri](http://lparchive.org/Sid-Meiers-Alpha-Centauri/) - A classic 4X Civ game
   * Alpha Centauri is essentially Civilization II, but on another planet. However, the interesting narrative and characters, as well as the innovative setting for its time, helped to make it a popular game. Although its influence has faded as time passed, it was commonly referenced in the late 90's and early 00's. This particular LP adds a bit more narrative to the story.

* [Medieval II: Total War - A Scotsman in Egypt](http://lparchive.org/A-Scotsman-In-Egypt/) - The golden standard of narratives
   * It is 1080. William the Conqueror rules England, the Dark Ages have just begun, and two Scottish princes are waking up from their hangovers, only to find that they are on an invasion fleet headed towards Egypt. The result will fill a 200 year chronicle and change the course of human history. Also has a prequel, [An Egyptian in Scotland](http://lparchive.org/An-Egyptian-in-Scotland/). 

* [Minesweeper](http://lparchive.org/Minesweeper/) - What's yours is minesweeper
   * Canada must always be ready in case of an American invasion. To prepare their peacekeeping troops for the horrors of war, they are put through the toughest training exercise known to man: sweeping for live mines. Many lives are lost, and many Maple Hearts given out, but this ragtag band of recruits will stop at nothing to protect their country.

* /r/Excel - Stuck at work with a Windows computer that is totally locked down? With the power of bloated Excel, you can create a GUI with Visual Basic to access the Win32 API, and create helpful tools, basic games, a Web Browser form, even a media player that streams movies from your SSH home server. And all processes are shown as subdivisions of Excel! It's the equivalent of a programmable calculator for cubicle workers.
